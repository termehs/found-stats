# Random Variables
In many real-world situations, from rolling a die to measuring rainfall, we deal with outcomes that are inherently uncertain. To make sense of this uncertainty, we use **random variables**: mathematical tools that assign numerical values to the outcomes of random processes. They allow us to translate chance into structure, giving us a way to analyze and predict patterns in uncertain environments.

This section introduces the concept of random variables and the probability distributions that describe their behavior. A probability distribution not only lists the possible values a random variable can take, but also tells us how likely each value is to occur. Whether the variable counts discrete outcomes or measures continuous quantities, understanding its distribution is key to interpreting the role of randomness in data, decisions, and models.

## What is a Random Variable?

In statistics, sampling should always be done randomly. This means that before the sampling occurs, we do not know who will be selected; it’s a random experiment where all individuals in the population are possible outcomes.

To introduce the idea of a random variable (also called a stochastic variable), imagine a small population of six individuals: Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Erin, Finn.
This is shown in @fig-rv1.


We are not primarily interested in the individuals themselves, but in the values they hold on some variable. For example, suppose we want to study whether each person has a driver's license. Let’s assign a value of 1 to those who have a license and 0 to those who don’t. Now, instead of thinking about names, our outcome space transforms into a set of 1's and 0's,  depending on the presence or absence of a driver’s license.  This is shown in @fig-rv2.

In probability theory, we often want to describe a random experiment using a variable before the experiment is carried out. Because we do not know in advance what the outcome will be, we use a random variable to represent the result. This variable is typically denoted by a capital letter, such as $X$, $Y$, or $Z$, often chosen from the end of the alphabet.

For example, we might define the variable $X$ as:

$X$ = Number of people with a driver’s license


This variable can take on different values depending on who is selected during the sampling process.
By grouping all individuals who share the same outcome value for our variable, we divide the outcome space into **disjoint events**. Suppose we define the event $A$ as:  "A randomly selected individual has a driver’s license."

This allows us to split the outcome space into two distinct parts: those with $X = 1$ (event $A$), and those with $X = 0$ (event $\bar{A}$), as shown in @fig-rv3.

If three of the six individuals in the population have a license, then the probability of selecting a person with a license is:

$$
P(X = 1) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
$$

And the probability of selecting someone without a license is:

$$
P(X = 0) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
$$

This defines the **probability distribution** of the variable $X$. Note that we can construct an infinite number of random variables for the same random experiment.
For instance, if we use the same group of six people, we could define a new variable $X$ to represent vaccination instead of license status. Then we would need to specify what values the variable takes (e.g., 1 = vaccinated, 0 = not vaccinated), define the corresponding event $A$, and determine the resulting probability distribution for this new version of $X$.

Once the random event has occurred and the experiment is completed, the stochastic variable will have assumed a specific value. At that point, we switch notation and use lowercase letters (such as $x$, $y$, or $z$) to refer to the observed values.
We write $P(x) = P(X = x)$, which defines the **probability function** for the variable $X$. This function tells us the likelihood that $X$ takes on specific values $x$.

In summary, a random variable is a numerical variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random experiment. Before the experiment is performed, we don’t know what value the variable will take, but we do know the set of possible values it may assume. Once the experiment is conducted, the variable takes on a definite value, and we can analyze its behavior using its probability distribution.

We use uppercase letters like $X$ to denote random variables, and the corresponding lowercase letters (like $x$) to represent actual outcomes. Depending on the context, random variables may be **discrete** or **continuous**, and each has its own type of probability model.

## Discrete vs. Continuous Random Variables

A **discrete** stochastic variable is one that can only take on a countable number of values. This might be a finite set, or it could be an infinite but countable one. Common examples include:

- The number of dots shown when rolling a die
- The sum of two dice rolls
- The number of trials needed to roll a six
- The number of girls in a randomly selected family with three children

On the other hand, a **continuous** stochastic variable can take on any value within an interval of the real number line. These variables are useful for modeling quantities that are measured rather than counted. Some examples include:

- The length of a randomly selected newborn child
- The lifespan of a randomly chosen light bulb
- The annual income of a randomly chosen household

## Exercises
For each of the random variables below, decide whether it is discrete or continuous:

1. The number of books a student checked out from the library this week  
2. The time (in minutes) it takes a person to run 5 kilometers  
3. The number of heads in 10 coin tosses  
4. A person’s height (in centimeters)  
5. The number of emails received in one day  
6. The daily average temperature in a city (in °C)  
7. Whether a person owns a smartphone (yes = 1, no = 0)

## Solution 
1. **Discrete** – counts books, can only be whole numbers  
2. **Continuous** – time can be measured with decimals (e.g., 23.75 minutes)  
3. **Discrete** – number of heads is a count between 0 and 10  
4. **Continuous** – height is measurable and can take any value in a range  
5. **Discrete** – number of emails is countable  
6. **Continuous** – temperature is measured on a continuous scale  
7. **Discrete** – binary variable (yes/no)
