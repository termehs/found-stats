# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Hi there, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This little book is a growing collection of my lecture notes for an undergrad **Introductory Stats** course. Itâ€™s here to help you make sense of statistics, whether youâ€™re taking the class or just randomly curious about what standard deviations and $p$-values are all about.

We start with the basics: what stats actually *is*, a bit of math warm-up, and how we wrangle surveys and data types. Then we roll into the good stuff: summarizing data, dabbling in probability, playing with random variables, and diving into sampling and inference (yes, including the infamous hypothesis tests).

Further down the line, we get into things like chi-square tests, regression, and thereâ€™s even a stash of handy stat tables at the end for those moments when you need a quick lookup.

> **Heads up:** this is still a work in progress, so things might move around or get polished as we go. If you spot anything weird, broken, or just plain confusing, do let me know. Iâ€™d love your feedback.

Happy learning!ðŸ¤“
