# Probability Rules

While some probabilities can be determined directly from counting outcomes, others require **probability rules** that help us break down complex situations.  Several fundamental rules govern probability calculations, ensuring consistency and logical reasoning:

- **The Complement Rule**: If an event $A$ has probability $P(A)$, then the probability of $A$ not occurring is:  $$P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$$
- **The Addition Rule**: When dealing with the probability of the union of events, we apply:
  $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $$
  (For **mutually exclusive** events, the formula simplifies to $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.)

- **Conditional Probability**: The probability of $A$ occurring given that $B$ has already occurred is:  
  $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$  
  
- **Multiplication Rule**: The probability of the joint occurrence of two events is:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)$$  
- **Independence**: Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other:
$$P(A \mid B) = P(A) \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$$  
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Used to reverse conditional probabilities, particularly in inference problems:  
  $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$  

We'll cover these in more details and examples in the following.

## The Complement Rule

he complement rule states that if an event $A$ has probability $P(A)$, then the probability that $A$ does not occur is:  
$$P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$$  
This rule is particularly useful when calculating the probability of "at least one" occurrences by considering the opposite event. See @fig-venn-comp.

#### Example 11.1: Deck of Cards {.unnumbered}

Determine the probability of drawing a ♦ (diamond), ♥ (heart), or ♠ (spade) when randomly selecting a card from a standard deck of 52 cards.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution 
The sample space consists of all 52 cards, so:  $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 52\}$  

Let $A$ be the event of drawing a ♦, ♥, or ♠.  The complement of $A$, denoted as $\overline{A}$, is the event of drawing a ♣ (club). Since there are 13 clubs in a deck, the probability of $\overline{A}$ is:  
$$P(\overline{A}) = \frac{13}{52}$$  

Using the complement rule we get that:
$$P(A) = 1 - P(\overline{A}) = 1 - \frac{13}{52} = \frac{39}{52} = \frac{3}{4}$$
Thus, the probability of drawing a ♦, ♥, or ♠ is 3/4 (75%).

## The Addition Rule
The **addition rule** helps compute the probability of the union of two events (see @fig-venn-union):  
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$ 

::: center
![The union of events $A$ and $B$.](imgs/‎venn-union.png){#fig-venn-union fig-align="center" width="100%"}

If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive (disjoint), then it follows that 
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$ 
since there is no intersection between the two events. 


#### Example 11.2: Dice Roll 🎲   {.unnumbered}

Determine the probability of rolling an even number or a number greater than three when rolling a fair six-sided die.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
The sample space consists of all possible outcomes of a die roll:  
$$\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$  
Define the events:  

- $A$ = rolling an even number: $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$  
- $B$ = rolling a number greater than three: $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$  
- The intersection of these events ($A \cap B$) = numbers that are both even and greater than three:  $$A \cap B = \{4, 6\}$$  

The probabilities are
$$P(A) = \frac{3}{6}, \quad P(B) = \frac{3}{6}, \quad P(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{6}$$  
Using the addition rule
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
 we get that
$$P(A \cup B) = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{4}{6} $$  

Thus, the probability of rolling either an even number or a number greater than three is $\frac{4}{6}$ or approximately 0.667 (66.7%).

#### Example 11.2: Product Defects   {.unnumbered}
In the manufacturing process of a product, two types of defects, $A$ and $B$, can occur. Sometimes both defects appear together.  We are given the probabilities:  
$$P(A) = 0.01, \quad P(B) = 0.02, \quad P(A \cap B) = 0.005$$  
a. Determine the probability that a product has at least one of the two defects.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
We are looking for the union of the events $A$ and $B$:
$$P (A \cup  B) = 0.01 + 0.02 − 0.005 = 0.025 = 2.5\%$$
:::

b. What is the probability that a product will be defect-free?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
We are looking for the complement of the union of the events $A$ and $B$:
$$P (\overline{A \cup B}) = 1 − P (A \cup B) = 1 − 0.025 = 0.975 = 97.5\%$$
:::

c. What is the probability that a product will have exactly one defect?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

We are looking for the shaded area in @fig-venn-ex which is given by
$$P(A \cup  B) − P (A \cap B) = 0.025 − 0.005 = 0.02 = 2\%$$

### The Union of Three or More Events

To compute the probability of the union of three events $A$, $B$, and $C$ as shown in @fig-venn-three we use the generalized addition rule:

$\qquad \qquad \qquad  P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)$

$$\quad \qquad \qquad  - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C)$$

$$+P(A \cap B \cap C)$$  
This formula ensures that overlapping probabilities are not double-counted when summing individual event probabilities.

:::

To generalize it even further for $n$ events $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, the probability of their union follows the **principle of inclusion-exclusion**:

$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right) =
\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i) - 
\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} P(A_i \cap A_j)$

$$
\qquad + \sum_{1 \leq i < j < k \leq n} P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) 
- \dots + (-1)^{n+1} P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n)  
$$
This pattern continues, alternating between adding and subtracting intersections of increasing size.

## Conditional Probability
Imagine you’re waiting for a pizza delivery. Normally, the probability of the delivery driver being on time (event $B$) might not be great. But then you receive a text message saying, *“Your order is on the way!”* (event $A$ has occurred).  Now that you have extra information, your estimate of $P(B)$ should change, right? That’s the essence of conditional probability; updating what we know when we gain new insight.  

We originally wanted to find the probability of $B$ happening, i.e., $P(B)$. But now we’ve been given a game-changing update: $A$ has happened. That means our world is now limited to the subset of outcomes where $A$ is true.  In other words, we’re no longer looking at the whole sample space $\Omega$ - our new reality is just $A$!  

So, the updated probability of $B$ given that $A$ has occurred, the so called **conditional probability** of $B$ given $A$, written as $P(B \mid A)$, is calculated using:

$$
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
$$  
where **$P(A) > 0$** (because if $A$ didn’t happen, there’s no reason to update anything). This formula quantifies how the probability of $B$ changes when we have additional information that $A$ has occurred.

Conditional probability is like getting insider information: 

- Did your team win the game? If they were leading at halftime, the probability changes.  
- Is your package arriving today? If it was shipped yesterday, chances are better.  
- Are you likely to pass your exam? If you've studied, your odds are much higher!
