# Probability Rules

While some probabilities can be determined directly from counting outcomes, others require **probability rules** that help us break down complex situations.  Several fundamental rules govern probability calculations, ensuring consistency and logical reasoning:

- **The Complement Rule**: If an event $A$ has probability $P(A)$, then the probability of $A$ not occurring is:  $$P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$$
- **The Addition Rule**: When dealing with the probability of the union of events, we apply:
  $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $$
  (For **mutually exclusive** events, the formula simplifies to $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.)

- **Conditional Probability**: The probability of $A$ occurring given that $B$ has already occurred is:  
  $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$  
  
- **Multiplication Rule**: The probability of the joint occurrence of two events is:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)$$  
- **Independence**: Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other:
$$P(A \mid B) = P(A) \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$$  
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Used to reverse conditional probabilities, particularly in inference problems:  
  $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$  

We'll cover these in more details and examples in the following.

## The Complement Rule

he complement rule states that if an event $A$ has probability $P(A)$, then the probability that $A$ does not occur is:  
$$P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$$  
This rule is particularly useful when calculating the probability of "at least one" occurrences by considering the opposite event. See @fig-venn-comp.

#### Example 11.1: Deck of Cards {.unnumbered}

Determine the probability of drawing a ♦ (diamond), ♥ (heart), or ♠ (spade) when randomly selecting a card from a standard deck of 52 cards.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution 
The sample space consists of all 52 cards, so:  $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 52\}$  

Let $A$ be the event of drawing a ♦, ♥, or ♠.  The complement of $A$, denoted as $\overline{A}$, is the event of drawing a ♣ (club). Since there are 13 clubs in a deck, the probability of $\overline{A}$ is:  
$$P(\overline{A}) = \frac{13}{52}$$  

Using the complement rule we get that:
$$P(A) = 1 - P(\overline{A}) = 1 - \frac{13}{52} = \frac{39}{52} = \frac{3}{4}$$
Thus, the probability of drawing a ♦, ♥, or ♠ is 3/4 (75%).

## The Addition Rule
The **addition rule** helps compute the probability of the union of two events (see @fig-venn-union):  
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$ 

::: center
![The union of events $A$ and $B$.](imgs/‎venn-union.png){#fig-venn-union fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::


If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive (disjoint), then it follows that 
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$ 
since there is no intersection between the two events. 


#### Example 11.2: Dice Roll 🎲   {.unnumbered}

Determine the probability of rolling an even number or a number greater than three when rolling a fair six-sided die.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
The sample space consists of all possible outcomes of a die roll:  
$$\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$  
Define the events:  

- $A$ = rolling an even number: $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$  
- $B$ = rolling a number greater than three: $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$  
- The intersection of these events ($A \cap B$) = numbers that are both even and greater than three:  $$A \cap B = \{4, 6\}$$  

The probabilities are
$$P(A) = \frac{3}{6}, \quad P(B) = \frac{3}{6}, \quad P(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{6}$$  
Using the addition rule
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
 we get that
$$P(A \cup B) = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{4}{6} $$  

Thus, the probability of rolling either an even number or a number greater than three is $\frac{4}{6}$ or approximately 0.667 (66.7%).

#### Example 11.2: Product Defects   {.unnumbered}
In the manufacturing process of a product, two types of defects, $A$ and $B$, can occur. Sometimes both defects appear together.  We are given the probabilities:  
$$P(A) = 0.01, \quad P(B) = 0.02, \quad P(A \cap B) = 0.005$$  
a. Determine the probability that a product has at least one of the two defects.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
We are looking for the union of the events $A$ and $B$:
$$P (A \cup  B) = 0.01 + 0.02 − 0.005 = 0.025 = 2.5\%$$
:::

b. What is the probability that a product will be defect-free?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
We are looking for the complement of the union of the events $A$ and $B$:
$$P (\overline{A \cup B}) = 1 − P (A \cup B) = 1 − 0.025 = 0.975 = 97.5\%$$
:::

c. What is the probability that a product will have exactly one defect?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

We are looking for the shaded area in @fig-venn-ex which is given by
$$P(A \cup  B) − P (A \cap B) = 0.025 − 0.005 = 0.02 = 2\%$$

### The Union of Three or More Events

To compute the probability of the union of three events $A$, $B$, and $C$ as shown in @fig-venn-three we use the generalized addition rule:

$\qquad \qquad \qquad  P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)$

$$\quad \qquad \qquad  - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C)$$

$$+P(A \cap B \cap C)$$  
This formula ensures that overlapping probabilities are not double-counted when summing individual event probabilities.

::: center

:::

To generalize it even further for $n$ events $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, the probability of their union follows the **principle of inclusion-exclusion**:

$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right) =
\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i) - 
\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} P(A_i \cap A_j)$

$$
\qquad + \sum_{1 \leq i < j < k \leq n} P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) 
- \dots + (-1)^{n+1} P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n)  
$$
This pattern continues, alternating between adding and subtracting intersections of increasing size.

## Conditional Probability
Imagine you’re waiting for a pizza delivery. Normally, the probability of the delivery driver being on time (event $B$) might not be great. But then you receive a text message saying, *“Your order is on the way!”* (event $A$ has occurred).  Now that you have extra information, your estimate of $P(B)$ should change, right? That’s the essence of conditional probability; updating what we know when we gain new insight.  

We originally wanted to find the probability of $B$ happening, i.e., $P(B)$. But now we’ve been given a game-changing update: $A$ has happened. That means our world is now limited to the subset of outcomes where $A$ is true.  In other words, we’re no longer looking at the whole sample space $\Omega$ - our new reality is just $A$!  

So, the updated probability of $B$ given that $A$ has occurred, the so called **conditional probability** of $B$ given $A$, written as $P(B \mid A)$, is calculated using:

$$
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
$$  
where **$P(A) > 0$** (because if $A$ didn’t happen, there’s no reason to update anything). This formula quantifies how the probability of $B$ changes when we have additional information that $A$ has occurred.

Conditional probability is like getting insider information: 

- Did your team win the game? If they were leading at halftime, the probability changes.  
- Is your package arriving today? If it was shipped yesterday, chances are better.  
- Are you likely to pass your exam? If you've studied, your odds are much higher!  



#### Example 11.3: Conditional Probability   {.unnumbered}

We are given a population of individuals where:

- 40% are men  
- 60% are women  

Furthermore, we know that:

- 28% of the population are smokers, of which 8% are male and 20% are female  

A person is randomly selected from the population.

We are interested in finding the following conditional probabilities:

(a) What is the probability that the person is a smoker, given that the person is male?

(b) What is the probability that the person is a smoker, given that the person is female?

(c) What is the probability that the person is female, given that the person is a smoker?

We define the following events:

- $A$: the person is a woman  
- $\bar{A}$: the person is a man  
- $B$: the person is a smoker  
- $\bar{B}$: the person is a non-smoker  

and the probabilities given for the events:

- $P(A) = 0.6$
- $P(\bar{A}) = 0.4$
- $P(B) = 0.28$
- $P(\bar{B}) = 0.72$
- $P(A \cap B) = 0.20$
- $P(\bar{A} \cap B) = 0.08$

To help us calculate conditional probabilities, we construct a **contingency table** that shows joint and marginal probabilities. We fill in the parts given to us:

|                  | Woman ($A$) | Man ($\bar{A}$) | Total |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Smoker ($B$)**       | 0.20      | 0.08              | 0.28  |
| **Non-smoker ($\bar{B}$)** | ?         | ?                 | 0.72  |
| **Total**        | 0.60      | 0.40              | 1.00  |

To fill in the remaining cells, we use subtraction:
$$P(A \cap \bar{B}) = P(A) - P(A \cap B) = 0.60 - 0.20 = 0.40$$
$$P(\bar{A} \cap \bar{B}) = P(\bar{A}) - P(\bar{A} \cap B) = 0.40 - 0.08 = 0.32$$

The complete table is then given below:

|                  | Woman ($A$) | Man ($\bar{A}$) | Total |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Smoker ($B$)**       | 0.20      | 0.08              | 0.28  |
| **Non-smoker ($\bar{B}$)** | 0.40         | 0.32                 | 0.72  |
| **Total**        | 0.60      | 0.40              | 1.00  |

With the help of this table, and the equation for conditional probability above, we can now find the asked probabilities (a)--(c).


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution (a)
(a) Smoker given man:  
$$P(B \mid \bar{A}) = \frac{P(B \cap \bar{A})}{P(\bar{A})}
= \frac{0.08}{0.40} = 0.2$$
So, the probability that a person is a smoker given that he is a man is 20%.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution (b)
Smoker given woman:
$$
   P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{0.20}{0.60} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333
$$
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution (c)
Woman given smoker:
$$
   P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.20}{0.28} \approx 0.714
$$

## The Multiplication Rule
From the definition of conditional probability, we can derive what is known as the **multiplication rule**.

For two events $A$ and $B$, the following holds:  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)
$$

This rule is particularly useful when determining the joint probability of two events that are not independent.

#### Example 11.4: Defective Items  {.unnumbered}

Consider a batch of 100 items, out of which 5 are defective.

We randomly select one item from the 100. Then, without replacing the first, we randomly select another from the remaining 99 items.

We want to find the probability that both selected items are defective.

Define the events:

- $A$: "The first selected item is defective"  
- $B$: "The second selected item is defective"

We are interested in computing $P(A \cap B)$
and we know that $P(A) = \frac{5}{100}$   and $P(B \mid A) = \frac{4}{99}$  (since one defective item has been removed, 4 defective remain out of 99 items.)
Now we apply the multiplication rule:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A) = \frac{5}{100} \cdot \frac{4}{99} = \frac{20}{9900} = \frac{1}{495}$$
Alternatively, we could have used combinatorics to solve the problem. Can you see how? 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution 
We want the probability of choosing 2 defective items out of 5, from a total of 100:

$$P(\text{both defective}) = \frac{\binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{95}{0}}{\binom{100}{2}} = \frac{10 \cdot 1}{4950} = \frac{1}{495}$$

So, both the multiplication rule and combinatorics give us the same result: the probability is $\frac{1}{495}$
