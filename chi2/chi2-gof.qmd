# Goodness-of-Fit Test {#sec-chi2gof}

In this section, we address how to test whether a categorical distribution fits a specified probability distribution. We have $n$ observations categorized into $K$ distinct categories:

| Category | Observed Count |
|----------|----------------|
| 1        | $O_1$          |
| 2        | $O_2$          |
| 3        | $O_3$          |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$       |
| $K$      | $O_K$          |

Each $O_i$ represents the number of observations in category $i$, for $i = 1, 2, \dots, K$.

We let $P_i$ denote the theoretical probability of an observation falling into category $i$, where the sum of all category probabilities must satisfy:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{K} P_i = 1
$$

We want to test whether the actual observed distribution matches a known or hypothesized distribution with fixed probabilities $P^*_1, P^*_2, \dots, P^*_K$.

-   **Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): The data follow the expected probabilities

    $H_0: P_1 = P^*_1,\ P_2 = P^*_2,\ \dots,\ P_K = P^*_K$

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$): The data do not follow the expected probabilities.

    $H_0:$ at least one of the $P_i$ differs from $P^*_i$.

If the null hypothesis is true, we *expect* the number of observations in each category to be: $$
E_i = n \cdot P^*_i
$$

This leads to the following extended table:

| Category | Observed Count $O_i$ | Probability $P^*_i$ | Expected Count $E_i = n \cdot P^*_i$ |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | $O_1$ | $P^*_1$ | $E_1$ |
| 2 | $O_2$ | $P^*_2$ | $E_2$ |
| 3 | $O_3$ | $P^*_3$ | $E_3$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| $K$ | $O_K$ | $P^*_K$ | $E_K$ |
| **Total** | $n$ | $1$ | $n$ |

We use the chi-square test statistic defined by: $$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$ where:

-   $O_i$ is the observed frequency for category $i$
-   $E_i$ is the expected frequency for category $i$ under $H_0$

This test statistic follows approximately a chi-square distribution with $(K - 1)$ degrees of freedom, assuming that all expected counts $E_i$ are sufficiently large (usually at least 5).

A large value of $\chi^2$ indicates a large discrepancy between observed and expected counts, which provides evidence against the null hypothesis. We compare the test statistic to a critical value from the $\chi^2$ distribution table or compute a $p$-value.

If the $p$-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject $H_0$ and conclude that the observed distribution does not fit the expected distribution.

#### Example 24.1: Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit Test for Color Preference {.unnumbered}

Letâ€™s conduct a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to examine whether a product is equally preferred in four different colors. We ask 80 randomly selected potential customers about their preferred color, and the responses are summarized as follows:

| Color     | Observed Count ($O_i$) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 1         | 12                     |
| 2         | 40                     |
| 3         | 8                      |
| 4         | 20                     |
| **Total** | **80**                 |

**Step 1: Hypotheses**\
We want to test if all colors are equally preferred.

$H_0$: The colors are equally preferred, i.e., $P_1 = P_2 = P_3 = P_4 = 0.25$

$H_1$: Not all colors are equally preferred.

**Step 2: Significance Level**\
We choose a significance level of\
$$\alpha = 0.05$$

**Step 3: Test Statistic**\
We use the chi-square test statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$ where:

-   $O_i$ = observed frequency\
-   $E_i$ = expected frequency under $H_0$\
-   $k = 4$ categories

Degrees of freedom:\
$$
\text{df} = k - 1 = 3
$$

**Step 4: Decision Rule**\
From the chi-square distribution table (@sec-chi2tbl), the critical value at\
$$ \chi^2_{3, 0.05} = 7.815 $$

Reject $H_0$ if:\
$$ \chi^2_{\text{obs}} > 7.815 $$

**Step 5: Observation**\
We compute the expected frequency for each category:\
$$ E_i = n \cdot P_i = 80 \cdot 0.25 = 20 $$

| Color     | $O_i$ | $E_i$ | $(O_i - E_i)^2 / E_i$ |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------------------|
| 1         | 12    | 20    | 3.20                  |
| 2         | 40    | 20    | 20.00                 |
| 3         | 8     | 20    | 7.20                  |
| 4         | 20    | 20    | 0.00                  |
| **Total** |       |       | **30.40**             |

Now we can compute the test statistic:\
$$
\chi^2_{\text{obs}} = 3.20 + 20.00 + 7.20 + 0.00 = 30.40
$$

**Step 6: Conclusion**\
Since\
$$
\chi^2_{\text{obs}} = 30.40 > 7.815 = \chi^2_{3, 0.05}
$$ We *reject the null hypothesis* at the 5% significance level. There is a statistically significant difference in color preferences among consumers.

#### Example 23.2: Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit {.unnumbered}

We want to test whether the market shares of three competing products (A, B, and C) have changed after a recent modification to product C.

**Step 1: Hypotheses**\
We assume that the historical market shares were:

-   Product A: 30%
-   Product B: 50%
-   Product C: 20%

We test:

$H_0: p_A = 0.30,\quad p_B = 0.50,\quad p_C = 0.20$

$H_1:$ The proportions are not equal to those specified under $H_0$

**Step 2: Significance level**\
We use a significance level of:

$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$

**Step 3: Test statistic**\
We use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test statistic: $$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$ Degrees of freedom: $$
df = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
$$

**Step 4: Decision rule**\
We reject the null hypothesis if: $$
\chi^2_{\text{obs}} > \chi^2_{2, 0.05} = 5.991
$$

**Step 5: Observation**\
From a survey of 200 customers:

| Product | Observed ($O_i$) | Expected proportion ($p^*_i$) | Expected count ($E_i = 200 \cdot p^*_i$) |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| A | 48 | 0.30 | 60 |
| B | 98 | 0.50 | 100 |
| C | 54 | 0.20 | 40 |

Now compute the observed value of the test statistic: $$
\chi^2_{\text{obs}} = \frac{(48 - 60)^2}{60} + \frac{(98 - 100)^2}{100} + \frac{(54 - 40)^2}{40} = 7.34
$$

**Step 6: Conclusion**\
Since: $$
\chi^2_{\text{obs}} = 7.34 > \chi^2_{2, 0.05} = 5.991,
$$ we *reject the null hypothesis* at the 5% significance level. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the market shares for products A, B, and C have changed.



## Exercises {.unnumbered}

1.  A factory produces light bulbs that are supposed to have three brightness levels in the following proportions:

-   Low: 20%\

-   Medium: 50%\

-   High: 30%

    In a random sample of 200 light bulbs, the observed distribution is:

-   Low: 38\

-   Medium: 92\

-   High: 70

    Test whether the observed distribution fits the expected proportions at the 5% significance level.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

**Step 1: Hypotheses**

-   $H_0$: The population distribution follows the claimed proportions (20%, 50%, 30%).
-   $H_1$: The distribution does not follow these proportions.

**Step 2: Significance level**\
- Use $\alpha = 0.05$

**Step 3: Test statistic**\
We use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test statistic: $$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

**Step 4: Observation**\
Total sample size: $n = 200$\
Claimed proportions:

-   Low: $p_1 = 0.20$\
-   Medium: $p_2 = 0.50$\
-   High: $p_3 = 0.30$

Expected counts:

$$
\begin{split}
& E_1  = 200 \times 0.20 = 40 \\ &
E_2 = 200 \times 0.50 = 100 \\ &
E_3 = 200 \times 0.30 = 60
\end{split}
$$

Expected frequencies:

| Category | Observed ($O_i$) | Expected ($E_i$) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Low      | 38               | 40               |
| Medium   | 92               | 100              |
| High     | 70               | 60               |

**Step 4: Decision rule**\
Degrees of freedom: $k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$\
Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.95, 2} = 5.991$\
Reject $H_0$ if observed value \> 5.991.

**Step 5: Observation**\
Our observed value is given by: $$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(38 - 40)^2}{40} + \frac{(92 - 100)^2}{100} + \frac{(70 - 60)^2}{60} \\
= \frac{4}{40} + \frac{64}{100} + \frac{100}{60} \\
= 0.10 + 0.64 + 1.67 = 2.41
$$

**Step 6: Conclusion**\
Since $2.41 < 5.991$, we fail to reject $H_0$. There is no significant difference between the observed and expected brightness levels. The data is consistent with the claimed distribution at the 5% level.

2.  Suppose a state lottery randomly draws one number from the integers 1 through 5 each week. Over 100 weeks, the frequency of each number is recorded. 

  | Number | Observed Frequency |
  |:----------|:------------------:|
  | 1 | 15 |
  | 2 | 24 |
  | 3 | 19 |
  | 4 | 22 |
  | 5 | 20 |

  Test whether these numbers are drawn uniformly, i.e., whether each number has an equal chance of being drawn.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

**Step 1: Hypotheses**\
$H_0$: The numbers are uniformly distributed (random).\
$H_1$: The numbers are not uniformly distributed.

**Step 2: Significance Level**\
Let $\alpha = 0.05$

**Step 3: Decision Rule**\
Degrees of freedom = $k - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$\
From table; $\chi^2_{0.05, 4} = 9.488$ which we reject if our observed value is greater than.

**Step 4: Test Statistic**\
The Chi-square statistic is:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

**Step 5: Observation**\
If the distribution is uniform, each number is expected to occur:

$$
E = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ times}
$$

So, expected counts for all five categories = 20.

Calculating: $$
\begin{aligned}
\chi^2 &= \frac{(15 - 20)^2}{20} + \frac{(24 - 20)^2}{20} + \frac{(19 - 20)^2}{20} + \frac{(22 - 20)^2}{20} + \frac{(20 - 20)^2}{20} \\
&= \frac{25}{20} + \frac{16}{20} + \frac{1}{20} + \frac{4}{20} + \frac{0}{20} \\
&= 1.25 + 0.8 + 0.05 + 0.2 + 0 \\
&= 2.3
\end{aligned}
$$

**Step 6: Conclusion**\
Since $2.3 < 9.488$, we fail to reject $H_0$. There is no evidence to suggest the lottery numbers are not drawn uniformly. The observed differences could be due to chance.
