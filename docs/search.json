The definition of a population can vary based on the research objective and can be finite (e.g., employees in a company) or infinite (e.g., potential customers in a market). A sample is a selected subset of the population. (inlcude figure)\nA census (or total survey) involves collecting data from every individual in a given population. This is common in national population counts but is often impractical for other types of research due to cost and time constraints. Instead, most studies rely on sample surveys which aim to generalize findings from the sample to the entire population with reasonable accuracy. The size of the sample (sample size) plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of the conclusions drawn.\nOne way to understand sampling is through the urn metaphor (Figure¬†3.1): Imagine an urn filled with different-colored balls representing different individuals in a population.

When measuring a particular characteristic, we can calculate various population metrics such as:\n\nMean (average), e.g., the average height of individuals in a population.\nProportion, e.g., the percentage of women in a population.\nTotal values, e.g., the total number of items owned by a group.\nCounts of specific attributes, e.g., the number of people with a particular qualification.\n\nThe main challenge in survey research is determining how accurately a sample represents the entire population. Statistical methods help estimate key characteristics of a population based on sample data.\nThese population characteristics are fixed parameters values which are usually unknown. Common parameters are the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) representing the true average of a characteristic in the population, or the proportion (\\(p\\)) representing the fraction of the population with a certain attribute.\nSince parameters cannot always be measured directly, they are estimated using sample statistics. For example, the sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) based on sampled observations \\(x_1,x_2,\\ldots, x_n\\) is used to estimate the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)). (include figure)\nTo distinguish between parameters and estimates, Greek letters are typically used for population parameters, while Latin letters are used for sample estimates. We will however avoid using already taken parameters, for example \\(\\pi\\) is not here used for population parameter as this already has a value assigned to it. In such cases we use the Latin letter to indicate the parameter and a ‚Äòhat‚Äô over the letter indicate the sample estimate (that is \\(\\hat{p}\\)).",

    "text": "3.3 Types of Surveys\nThe method chosen for collecting data in a survey plays a crucial role in determining the accuracy and reliability of the results. Broadly, survey research can be classified into experimental and non-experimental approaches, each serving different research purposes.\n\n3.3.1 Experimental Surveys\nExperimental surveys are designed to explore causal relationships between variables.Here, researchers have control over certain conditions, manipulating one or more variables while keeping others constant to observe the effects. A key feature of experimental surveys is randomization, where participants are randomly assigned to different groups to eliminate bias. By ensuring that external factors do not influence the results, researchers can draw strong conclusions about cause and effect.\nOne common application of experimental surveys is in medical research, where clinical trials are conducted to test the effectiveness of a new drug. In such cases, patients might be randomly assigned to either a treatment group receiving the drug or a control group receiving a placebo. The outcomes are then compared to determine the drug‚Äôs efficacy. Similarly, in marketing, companies may experiment with different advertising strategies by exposing randomly selected groups to different promotional campaigns and then measuring their purchasing behavior.\nWhile experimental surveys provide strong evidence of causal relationships, they do have some limitations. They tend to be resource-intensive, requiring significant time and financial investment. Furthermore, ethical considerations may restrict certain types of experiments, especially in cases where withholding treatment or intervention from a control group could have serious consequences. Another challenge is that controlled settings may not fully capture real-world complexities, making it difficult to generalize findings beyond the experimental conditions.",

    "text": "3.4 Non-Experimental Surveys: Observing Trends and Patterns\nUnlike experimental surveys, non-experimental surveys focus on observing and describing characteristics, trends, and relationships within a population without direct intervention. These surveys are widely used in fields such as social sciences, market research, and public policy analysis, where the goal is often to collect descriptive data rather than establish causality.\nOne of the most common types of non-experimental surveys is the cross-sectional survey, which captures data from a population at a single point in time. This method is frequently used in opinion polls, customer satisfaction studies, and demographic research. For example, a company might conduct a survey to understand consumer preferences for a new product just before its launch. Because cross-sectional surveys are quick and cost-effective, they are widely used.\nFor studies that require tracking changes over time, researchers may turn to longitudinal surveys, which collect data from the same subjects at multiple intervals. Longitudinal surveys are especially useful for understanding long-term trends, such as how consumer behavior evolves over the years or how health outcomes change in response to lifestyle choices. In a panel study, the same individuals are followed over time, whereas in a cohort study, a specific group‚Äîsuch as people born in a particular year‚Äîis tracked to observe changes as they age. These methods are valuable in policy research, where understanding the long-term effects of interventions, such as educational reforms or public health initiatives, is critical.\nSome non-experimental surveys rely on observational data, where researchers study behaviors and interactions without directly questioning participants. Observational studies often aim to identify associations and generate hypotheses for further research. This method is commonly used in consumer behavior research. For example, a supermarket might analyze shopping patterns by tracking how customers navigate store aisles without them being aware of the observation. Another example is web tracking which is a modern form of observational research where companies monitor users‚Äô online activities to analyze behavior, predict preferences, and personalize experiences. Unlike traditional observational studies, which are typically conducted with ethical oversight and clear participant consent, the presented examples often operates in the background without users‚Äô full awareness or control. Thus, while observational studies provide authentic behavioral insights, they raise ethical concerns about privacy and cannot establish direct cause-and-effect relationships.",

Think of these as variables holding countable values. Examples include number of children in a family, number of goals ina football match, and number of sales transactions per day.\nContinuous variables can take any value within a given range of values within an interval and can be infinitely divided (real numbers). Examples include hegiht, weight, stock price and distance.\n\n\n4.1.2 Qualitative (Categorical) Variables\nThese variables represent data that can be divided into distinct groups or categories. These values do not have a natural numerical order (except for ordinal variables) and must be coded into numerical values for statistical analysis. Examples include political affiliation, blood type, movie genre and social media platform.\nA special case of qualitative variables that take only two possible values, so called dichotomous or binary variable.

For example, there is no inherent ordering in the variable eye color (blue, brown, green), gender or nationality. You can only distinguish between the values nominal variables take.\nOrdinal scale is when data can be ranked in a meaningful order, but differences between values are not necessarily equal or meaningful, for example when looking at the variable fruit preference ranking or customer satisfaction levels (low, medium, high). In other words, interval lengths between one variable value and another are not of the same length.\nInterval scale is similar to the ordinal scale but with equal intervals between values. However, it lacks a true zero point. Examples include Temperature in Celsius and calendar years (the year 2000 is 100 years after 1900, but the year 0 does not represent the ‚Äúbeginning of time‚Äù).\nFinally, ratio scale has all of the above properties but also a natural zero point, allowing meaningful calculations of differences and ratios.

This preference distribution, also presented in the table below, will be used as a running example in the following.\n\n\nPreference\nCount (\\(f_i\\))\nPercentage (\\(f_i\\) in %)\n\n\n\nTea\n120\n40%\n\n\nCoffee\n180\n60%\n\n\nTotal\n300\n100%\n\n\n\nThe relative frequency is calculated as:\n\\[\\frac{120}{300} \\times 100 = 40\\%\\]\nand shown in the third column.\n\n5.1.2 Pie Chart\nPie charts are one of the most commonly used tools for representing categorical data in a simple, visual format. They break down a whole into proportional slices, making it easy to see relative differences between categories at a glance. Whether you‚Äôre comparing sales across different product categories, analyzing survey responses, or breaking down a budget, a well-made pie chart provides an intuitive way to present proportions.\nEach slice represents a category‚Äôs percentage of the total, with the entire pie equaling 100%. The size of each slice is determined by the proportion of the category it represents. For example, if 60% of survey respondents prefer coffee over tea, that category would take up 60% of the pie chart, or 60% of 360¬∞, that is \\(0.60 √ó 360¬∞ = 216¬∞\\) of the full circle. Pie charts are particularly effective when comparing a few distinct categories but lose clarity when too many slices are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a standard pie chart is a great way to visualize data, 3D pie charts are the dark side of data visualization. They may look fancy, but they distort proportions, making it difficult to accurately compare slice sizes. Due to the perspective effect, some slices appear larger or smaller than they actually are, leading to misleading interpretations. In short: if you want your data to be clear and not just flashy, stick to 2D pies - your audience will thank you.\n\n5.1.3 Bar Chart\nBar charts are a great way to visualize qualitative data, making it easy to compare different categories. Each category is represented by a bar, with the height corresponding to its frequency or percentage. For example, a bar chart would clearly display the difference between coffee and tea lovers, making it easy to interpret at a glance. Unlike pie charts, bar charts work well even when multiple categories are involved, ensuring your audience can quickly grasp the data - without any risk of 3D chart-induced confusion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Contingency Tables\nWhen we have observations on two qualitative variables, we can create two separate frequency tables. However, if we want to study the relationship between the two variables, we use a contingency table.\nA contingency table organizes paired observations, showing the frequency distribution across the two categorical variables.\nFor example, consider the following data where individuals are classified into two groups based on their marital status (Married (M) or Not Married (NM)) and their voting behavior (Voted (1) or Did Not Vote (0)). This results in four possible outcome combinations:\n\n(M, 0) - Married, Did Not Vote\n(M, 1) - Married, Voted\n(NM, 0) - Not Married, Did Not Vote\n(NM, 1) - Not Married, Voted\n\nAssume the first four observations are: (G, 0), (EG, 1), (G, 1), (G, 1) Which we create the following table over:\n\n\n\n0 (Did Not Vote)\n1 (Voted)\n\n\n\nM (Married)\n‚úîÔ∏è\n‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è\n\n\nNM (Not Married)\n\n‚úîÔ∏è\n\n\n\nOnce all observations have been recorded, we can create the following contingency table:\n\n\n\nDid Not Vote\nVoted\nTotal\n\n\n\nMarried\n54\n1496\n1550\n\n\nNot Married\n85\n628\n713\n\n\nTotal\n139\n2124\n2263\n\n\n\nThis table displays the distribution of voting behavior by marital status, where we can analyze differences between the groups.\nMarginal Distributions\nA marginal distribution summarizes the totals for each row and column in a contingency table. This helps us understand the overall distribution of each variable separately.\nFor example, the absolute and relative marginal distributions for marital status is shown below:\n\n\nMarital Status\nCount\nPercentage (%)\n\n\n\nMarried\n1550\n68.5%\n\n\nNot Married\n713\n31.5%\n\n\nTotal\n2263\n100%\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the absolute and relative marginal distributions for voting behvaior is shown below:\n\n\nVoting Behavior\nCount\nPercentage (%)\n\n\n\nDid Not Vote\n139\n6.1%\n\n\nVoted\n2124\n93.9%\n\n\nTotal\n2263\n100%\n\n\n\nThese tables summarize how many people are in each category without considering the second variable.\nConditional Distributions\nTo compare voting behavior between married and non-married individuals, we calculate row percentages.\n\n\n\nDid Not Vote (%)\nVoted (%)\nTotal (%)\n\n\n\nMarried\n3.5%\n96.5%\n100%\n\n\nNot Married\n11.9%\n88.1%\n100%\n\n\n\nThis table shows the conditional distribution of voting behavior, given marital status.\n\nAmong married individuals, 1496 √ó 100 = 0.965= 96.5% voted while 54 √ó 100 = 0.035 =3.5% did not.\nAmong non-married individuals, 88.1% voted, while 11.9% did not.\n\nBy comparing these row percentages, we can see that married individuals were more likely to vote compared to non-married individuals. We have calculated the percentages horizontally but compare the percentage values in the vertical columns. We can also compute column percentages instead of row percentages if needed.\nTo determine whether a relationship exists between voting behavior and marital status, we compare conditional distributions. Since the voting percentages differ between married and non-married groups, we conclude that marital status influences voting behavior. If the two variables were independent, the percentages in the columns would be nearly the same. The fact that they differ suggests an association between the two variables.",

The least frequent weights occur at the lower (20-21 g) and higher (25-26 g) ends.

It represents the point where half of the observations are below and half are above, making it a useful measure of central tendency for skewed distributions. Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by outliers, making it a more robust indicator of typical values in cases where extreme values exist. For example, in income data, the median often provides a better reflection of the typical salary than the mean, which can be skewed by very high incomes. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median position is found using: \\[\n\\frac{n + 1}{2}\n\\]\nExample 6.1: Income\nFor our sorted income data we get that the median is located at the position \\[\n\\frac{19}{2} = 9.5\n\\] The median is then the average of the 9th and 10th values (40 and 44):** \\[\n\\frac{40 + 44}{2} =42\n\\] Thus, the median income is 42 000 ‚Ç¨.",

It provides a measure of how much the data points differ from the central value.

Thus, it is better to use when you need an intuitive, practical measure of data spread in real-world scenarios.\nFor a population, the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is: \\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}}\n\\] For a sample, the standard deviation (\\(s\\)) is: \\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\n\\] which can also be rewritten as: \\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}{n(n-1)}}\n\\] following the alternative variance formula shown above.\nTo better understand the concept of standard deviation, we visualize the distribution of a data set in Figure¬†7.2 where the mean (blue) and standard deviation bands (red) are overlayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7.2: Histogram of data set of 100 0bservations with standard deviation bands included.\n\n\nExample: Test Scores\nReturning to our example on test scores, we previously calculated the sample mean as \\(\\bar{x} = 5.25\\).

This comparison shows that data set B has a significantly higher variability than data set A, meaning the scores are more dispersed from the average.",

    "text": "7.6 Covariance and Correlation\nWhen analyzing data, it is often important to understand the relationship between two variables. Measures such as covariance and correlation help quantify the degree to which two variables change together, allowing us to assess their association.\nCovariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). It tells us whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase or decrease in the other. For an entire population, the covariance is calculated as: \\[\nCov(X, Y) = \\sigma_{xy} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu_x)(y_i - \\mu_y)}{N}\n\\] where:\n\n\n\\(N\\) = total number of observations,\n\n\\(x_i, y_i\\) = individual data points,\n\n\\(\\mu_x \\mu_y\\) = means of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\nFor a sample, we estimate covariance using: \\[\nCov(X, Y) = s_{xy} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{n - 1}\n\\] where:\n\n\n\\(n\\) = sample size,\n\n\\(\\bar{x} ,\\bar{y}\\) = sample means of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\nHow do we interpret the covariance?\n\nIf we have positive covariance it means that when \\(X\\) increases, then \\(Y\\) also tends to increase (e.g., study time and exam scores).\nIf we have negative covariance it means that when \\(X\\) increases, then \\(Y\\) tends to decrease (e.g., speed and time taken to reach a destination).\nIf we have near zero covariance, then this indicates no significant linear relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (note however that it does not detect patterns where variables are related in a non-linear way e.g., quadratic or exponential relationships).\n\nOne limitation of covariance is that it depends on the units of measurement (same as for variance), making it difficult to interpret. This is where correlation comes in as it standardizes covariance by adjusting for the scales of the variables, providing a dimensionless measure that is easier to interpret. The population correlation (\\(\\rho\\)) is given by \\[\n\\rho = \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}\n\\] where \\(\\sigma_x,\\sigma_y\\) are the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The sample correlation (\\(r\\)) \\[\nr = \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{s_x s_y}\n\\] where \\(s_x, s_y\\) are the sample standard deviations. Correlation values fall within the range -1 to 1, with the following interpretations (we use sample correlation as example):\n\n\n\\(r = 1\\): perfect positive correlation; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) move together exactly in a straight line.\n\n\\(0.8 \\leq r &lt; 1\\): strong positive correlation; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) tend to increase together.\n\n\\(0.5 \\leq r &lt; 0.8\\): moderate positive correlation; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) show a noticeable increasing relationship.\n\n\\(0 &lt; r &lt; 0.5\\): weak positive correlation; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) tend to increase together, but with variability.\n\n\\(r = 0\\): no linear relationship; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not linearly related (but might be non-linearly associated).\n\n\\(-0.5 &lt; r &lt; 0\\): weak negative correlation; as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) tends to decrease slightly.\n\n\\(-0.8 &lt; r \\leq -0.5\\): moderate negative correlation; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) shown an inverse relationship.\n\n\\(-1 ‚â§ r ‚â§ -0.8\\): strong negative correlation; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) move in opposite directions strongly.\n\n\\(r = -1\\): perfect negative correlation; \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) move in exactly opposite directions in a straight line.\n\nA few examples are shown in Figure¬†7.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7.4: Simulated data showing different correlations.",

    "text": "8.2 Outcomes, Sample Space and Events\nThe result of a random experiment is called an outcome, and the set of all possible outcomes is known as the sample space, denoted as \\(\\Omega\\). A couple of examples are shown below:\nExperiment: Rolling a six-sided die\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)\nExperiment: Flipping a coin twice\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{\\text{heads, tails}), (\\text{heads, heads}), (\\text{tails, heads}), (\\text{tails, tails})\\}\\)\nIn probability theory, we are often more interested in the characteristics of outcomes rather than the individual outcomes themselves. An event is a collection of outcomes that share a common feature, allowing us to analyze probabilities more efficiently and identify meaningful patterns within the data. Events are typically denoted by uppercase letters such as \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) and are formally defined as subsets of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) Each event is characterized by the set of outcomes for which it occurs, meaning that an event is said to happen if and only if at least one of its associated outcomes is observed.\nConsider the follwing example. In a standard six-sided die roll üé≤, the sample space is given by: \\[\n\\Omega =\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\n\\]\nDifferent events can be defined as subsets of the sample space:\n\n\n\nEvent\nSubset of Sample Space\n\n\n\n\n\\(A\\) = Rolling an odd number\n\\(A = \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(B\\) = Rolling at most three\n\\(B = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(C\\) = Rolling a six\n\\(C = \\{6\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(D\\) = Not rolling a six\n\\(D = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(E\\) = Rolling a seven\n\\(E = \\emptyset\\) (empty set)\n\n\n\nIn this table, event \\(E\\) represents an impossible event since rolling a seven is not possible with a six-sided die, making its subset the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\).\n\nExample 8.1\nImagine randomly selecting a person from a lecture room. The sample space consists of all individuals present in the room. However, we are often more interested in certain characteristics rather than the specific individuals themselves.\nLet‚Äôs define the following events:\n\n\\(A\\) = The selected person wears glasses\n\n\\(B\\) = The selected person cycled to the university\n\nEach event consists of all outcomes where the selected individual satisfies the given condition. Suppose the randomly chosen person is Alex. If Alex wears glasses, then event \\(A\\) has occurred. If Alex also cycled to the university, then both events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have occurred simultaneously.\nNote that we here only considered one random experiment. In many real-world situations, random experiments are repeated multiple times instead of occurring just once. In such cases, each possible sample drawn represents an individual outcome.\nFor example, suppose we randomly select three students from the lecture room and ask them: ‚ÄúDid you cycle to today‚Äôs lecture?‚Äù.\nIf we let \\(Y\\) represent ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and \\(N\\) represent ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, the sample space consists of all possible sequences of answers: \\[\n\\Omega = \\{YYY, YYN, YNY, NYY, YNN, NYN, NNY, NNN\\}\n\\]\nand each outcome represents a specific combination of answers from the three selected students.\nRather than focusing on individual outcomes, we may be interested in how many of the selected students cycled to the lecture. This allows us to define events based on counts. For example, let‚Äôs define:\n\n\\(B_2\\) = Exactly two students cycled to the lecture\n\nThis event consists of all sequences where two of the three selected students answered ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, i.e.¬†\\[\nB_2 = \\{YYN, YNY, NYY\\}\n\\] Similarly, we can define:\n\n\\(B_0\\) = No students cycled to the lecture\n\n\\(B_1\\) = Exactly one student cycled to the lecture\n\n\\(B_3\\) = All three students cycled to the lecture\n\nSince one and only one of these events must occur, they are considered:\n\nExhaustive ‚Äì Together, they cover the entire sample space.\n\nMutually Exclusive ‚Äì No two of these events can occur at the same time.\n\nBy structuring probability problems in this way, we can analyze patterns in data and make probability calculations more intuitive.",

    "text": "8.3 Venn Diagram\nProbability theory frequently utilizes conecpts from set theory to describe relationships between events. Venn diagrams provide a visual representation of these concepts and illustrate how different events relate to one another within the sample space. By using set operations, we can define and show new events effectively.\nThe sample space \\(\\Omega\\) is often represented as a rectangle, where individual outcomes may be shown as dots inside. However, for simplicity, the dots are usually omitted (and sometimes even the rectangle is omitted).\nAn event is typically represented as a circle within the rectangle. If multiple events are considered, their circles may overlap, reflecting cases where both events can occur simultaneously.\nReturning to our previous example, imagine we again randomly select a student from a lecture hall. We define the following events:\n\n\\(A\\) = The selected student wears glasses\n\\(B\\) = The selected student cycled to the university\n\nThese events can be visualized in a Venn diagram, where each event is a circle, as shown in Figure¬†8.2. Their overlap represents students who meet both conditions. These is called the intersection of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and is one of three interesting areas that are of particular interest. We will cover each fo these in the following with reference to Figure¬†8.3 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8.2: Events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in sample space \\(\\Omega\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.1 The Intersection of Events\nHere we look for outcomes that belong to both events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The intersection of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is denoted as: \\[A \\cap B\\]\nand represents the set of all outcomes where both events occur simultaneously. This is shown in top-left diagram of Figure¬†8.3.\n\nExample 8.2\nConsider a standard six-sided die where the sample space is: \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) Define the following events:\n\n\\(A\\) = Rolling an odd number; \\(A = \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\)\n\\(B\\) = Rolling a number that is at most 3; \\(B = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\)\n\nThe intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) includes only the numbers that appear in both sets: \\[\nA \\cap B = \\{1, 3\\}\n\\] Thus, the intersection contains only the numbers 1 and 3, since these are the only values present in both events.\n\n\n\n8.3.2 The Union of Events\nWe now look for outcomes that belong to at least one of the two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The union of events, denoted as: \\[ A \\cup B \\] and represents the event that either \\(A\\), \\(B\\), or both occur. This is shown in bottom-left diagram of Figure¬†8.3.\n\nExample 8.3\nConsider a standard six-sided die where the sample space is: \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) Define the following events:\n\n\\(A\\) = Rolling an odd number; \\(A = \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\)\n\\(B\\) = Rolling a number that is at most 3; \\(B = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\)\n\nThe union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) includes all outcomes that belong to either event or both:\n\\[A \\cup B = \\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}\\]\nThus, the union contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5, since at least one of the events \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) includes each of these numbers.\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Complement of an Event\nFor every event \\(A\\), there exists a complement event, which consists of all outcomes that do not belong to event \\(A\\).\nThe complement of \\(A\\) is denoted as: \\[ \\overline{A} \\] and represents the event that \\(A\\) does not occur. This is shown in bottom-right diagram of Figure¬†8.3.\n\nExample 8.4\nConsider rolling a standard six-sided die, where the sample space is: \\[S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\] Define the following event:\n\n\\(A\\) = Rolling an odd number; \\(A=\\{1,3,5\\}\\)\n\nThe complement of \\(A\\) consists of all outcomes not included in \\(A\\): \\[\\overline{A}=\\{2,4,6\\}\\] Thus, the complement of rolling an odd number is rolling an even number.\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Mutually Exclusive Events\nIn some cases, events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) do not share any outcomes. Such events are called disjoint events, meaning they cannot occur simultaneously. Mathematically, this is written as: \\[A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\] where \\(\\emptyset\\) represents the empty set, meaning a set with no elements. This is shown in top-right diagram of Figure¬†8.3.\n\nExample 8.4\nConsider rolling a standard six-sided die, where the sample space is: \\[S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\]\nDefine the following events:\n\n\\(A\\) = Rolling an odd number; \\(A=\\{1,3,5\\}\\)\n\\(B\\) = Rolling an even number; \\(B=\\{2,4,6\\}\\)\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) do not have any numbers in common, we conclude: \\[A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\]\nThus, rolling an odd number and rolling an even number are mutually exclusive events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8.3: The intersection of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (top-left), mutually exhaustive events (top-right), the union of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (bottom-left) and the complement of event \\(A\\) (bottom-right).",

At its core, it relies on three fundamental assumptions that define how probabilities are assigned to different outcomes in a random experiment.\n\\[P(O_1) + P(O_2) + \\dots + P(O_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(O_i) = 1\\]\nThese fundamental principles form the backbone of probability theory, ensuring a structured and consistent way to reason about uncertain events. By defining probabilities within these constraints, we can build models that capture real-world randomness and variability in a mathematically rigorous way.\nThe probability of an event \\(A\\), denoted as \\(P(A)\\), is determined by summing the probabilities of all individual outcomes that make up \\(A\\): \\[ P(A) = \\sum_{O_i \\in A} P(O_i) \\]\nThis rule ensures that if an event consists of multiple possible outcomes, its probability is found by adding up the probabilities of each contributing outcome.\nSince probability values must be assigned consistently, we require a formal system that ensures logical coherence in probability calculations.

    "section": "\n9.3 Defining Probability",
    "text": "9.3 Defining Probability\nThe probability of an event \\(A\\), denoted as \\(P(A)\\), is a measure of how likely it is that the event will occur. Different interpretations of probability exist, leading to various probability definitions.\n\n9.3.1 The Classical Definition\nThe classical definition of probability, derived from basic counting principles, states that if a random experiment has \\(N\\) possible outcomes, and exactly \\(N_A\\) of these correspond to event \\(A\\) occurring, then the probability of \\(A\\) is given by: \\[P(A) = \\frac{N_A}{N}\\] This is known as a theoretical probability assignment, as it assumes that all outcomes are equally likely.\n\n9.3.2 The Frequentist Definition\nAn alternative way to define probability is through relative frequency. In the frequentist interpretation, the probability of an event \\(A\\) is understood as the proportion of times \\(A\\) occurs in a very long sequence of repeated random experiments. This can be expressed mathematically as: \\[P(A) \\approx \\frac{n_A}{n}\\] where:\n\n\n\\(n_A\\) is the number of times event \\(A\\) occurs.\n\n\\(n\\) is the total number of trials.\n\nAs the number of trials \\(n\\) increases, the relative frequency of event \\(A\\) stabilizes and approaches its probability \\(P(A)\\), aligning with the classical probability definition. In other words, if we repeat an experiment an extremely large number of times, the empirical probability we observe will converge toward a fixed value. This phenomenon is known as the stability of relative frequencies and serves as the empirical foundation of probability theory. It explains why probabilities can be estimated by repeated experimentation, as observed frequencies tend to settle around a fixed value over a large number of trials. AN example of this is shown below in Example 9.1.\nThis probability defintion is known as the empirical probability assignment, meaning that probabilities are assigned based on observed data rather than theoretical assumptions.\n\n9.3.3 The Subjective Definition\nAnother way to interpret probability is through subjective probability, where probability is understood as a*measure of personal belief in the occurrence of an event. Formally, the probability of an event \\(A\\) in this interpretation is given by:\n\\[P(A) = \\text{a measure of how strongly a person believes that } A \\text{ will occur}\\] For example, one might estimate the probability of rain tomorrow as 30%, or believe that the chance of Germany winning the next Eurovision Song Contest is 70%. These probabilities are not derived from mathematical models or repeated experiments but instead reflect an individual‚Äôs degree of confidence in a given outcome.\nThis approach known as the subjective probability assignment is commonly used in decision-making under uncertainty, such as betting, economics, and risk assessment, where probabilities are assigned based on available information, intuition, or expert judgment rather than empirical frequency or formal statistical models.\nExample 9.1: Stability of Relative Frequencies\nHow many sixes can we expect if we roll a die 10 times? 1000 times? 10,000 times?\nLet event \\(A\\) represent rolling a six when tossing a fair die. The theoretical probability of rolling a six is:\n\\[P(A) = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.167\\]\nThis suggests that in 10 rolls, we should expect approximately 1 to 2 sixes.\nTo illustrate this, nine people each rolled a die 10 times, producing the following results for the number of sixes obtained: \\(1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 5, 4, 0, 2\\)\nIn total, there were 90 rolls, with a total of: \\(1+3+1+2+2+5+4+0+2 = 20\\) occurrences of a six. The relative frequency of rolling a six in this experiment was: \\[\\frac{n_A}{n} = \\frac{20}{90} = 0.22\\]\nWhat happens if we roll the die many more times? Using a computer simulation, the die was rolled 1000, 10 000 and 100 000 times, resulting in 140, 1726, and 16 745 sixes. The results are summarized in Table¬†9.1.\n\n\nTable¬†9.1: Summary of rolling a fair six-sided die multiple times, showing how the relative frequency of rolling a six approaches the theoretical probability 0.167 (16.7%) as the number of trials increases.\n\n\n\nNumber of üé≤ Rolls\nNumber of Sixes\nRelative Frequency\n\n\n\n10\n2\n0.20 (20%)\n\n\n90\n20\n0.22 (22%)\n\n\n1,000\n140\n0.14 (14%)\n\n\n10,000\n1,726\n0.173 (17.3%)\n\n\n100,000\n16,745\n0.167 (16.75%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the number of trials increases, the observed relative frequency tends to stabilize around the theoretical probability. This illustrates the law of large numbers, which states that the empirical probability of an event converges to its theoretical probability as the number of trials increases.

    "text": "If a ball is drawn from an urn and returned before the next draw, then every selection remains independent, and the number of available choices does not change. This is known as drawing with replacement. For example, if an urn contains six balls, each ball has a \\(1/6\\) probability of being chosen, and this probability remains the same for every draw.\nIn contrast, drawing without replacement means that once a ball is selected, it is not returned to the urn. This affects the probability of subsequent draws. A common example is a lottery draw, where seven winning numbers are selected from a total of 35 balls. Since each number can only appear once, this is an example of drawing without replacement.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, order does matter. For example, imagine that a company requires employees to create five-letter security codes using the letters A, B, C, D, and E. Here the order of the letters celarly matters since password ABCDE is different from password ACBDE. This means the number of possible passwords availbale to choose from is determined by permutations, where order plays a role.\nIn other cases, order does not matter. Returning to the lottery example, suppose the machine selects the balls in the order 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. This sequence represents the same lottery result as if the balls had been drawn in the order 7,6,5,4,3,2,1. Since the order of selection does not change the outcome, this scenario follows combinations, where only the chosen numbers matter, not their sequence.\n\n\n\n10.1.1 Drawing with Replacement, Order Matters\n\nExample 9.3: PIN Code Generation\nConsider a four-digit PIN code, where each digit can be any number from 0 to 9. Since each digit is chosen independently and can be repeated, every unique sequence forms a distinct PIN code.\nThis is an example of permutations with repetition, where the total number of possible PIN codes is given by: \\[N^n\\] where:\n\n\\(N\\) is the number of available choices for each digit (10 digits: 0‚Äì9).\n\\(n\\) is the number of digits in the PIN code (4-digit code). Applying the formula: \\[10^4 = 10,000 \\]\n\nThis means there are 10,000 unique PIN codes that can be generated under these conditions.\n\n\nExample 9.4: Vehicle Registration Numbers in Sweden\nHow many possible vehicle registration numbers exist in Sweden? In Swedish license plates, a registration number consists of three letters followed by three digits. Since letters and digits can be repeated, this follows the rule of permutations with repetition.\nTo calculate the total number of possible license plates, we consider:\n\nThe first three characters are letters, chosen from 26 available options.\n\nThe last three characters are digits, chosen from 10 available options (0‚Äì9).\n\nUsing the multiplication principle, the total number of possible registration numbers is:\n\\[ 26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 26^3 \\times 10^3 = 17,576,000 \\]\nThis means that Sweden can issue up to 17.58 million unique vehicle registration numbers under this system. The formaula is generally written as \\(N_1^{n_1} \\times N_2^{n_2}\\) where:\n\n\\(N_1 = 26\\) (number of available letters), \\(n_1 = 3\\) (three letters chosen).\n\n\\(N_2 = 10\\) (number of available digits), \\(n_2 = 3\\) (three digits chosen).\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Drawing with Replacement, Ignoring Order\n\nExample 9.5: Selecting Ice Cream Flavors üç¶\nImagine an ice cream shop that offers six different flavors. A customer selects three scoops of ice cream, where:\n\nThe same flavor can be chosen multiple times (replacement).\n\nThe order of the scoops does not matter‚Äî choosing (vanilla, chocolate, vanilla) is the same as (chocolate, vanilla, vanilla).\n\nSince order is ignored, but repetition is allowed, we calculate the number of possible selections using combinations with replacement, given by the formula: \\[\\binom{N + n - 1}{n} = \\frac{(N + n - 1)!}{n!(N - 1)!} \\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(N = 6\\) (number of available flavors).\n\n\\(n = 3\\) (number of scoops selected).\n\nApplying the formula:\n\\[ \\binom{6+3-1}{3} = \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(5!)} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56 \\]\nThus, there are 56 different ways to choose three scoops of ice cream when order does not matter, but flavors can be repeated.\n\n\n\n10.1.3 Drawing without Replacement, Order Matters\n\nExample 9.6: Finalist Selection in ESC üé§üé∂\nIn the semi-final rounds of the Eurovision Song Contest, five countries have reached the last stage. The final ranking must be determined, where each country is assigned a unique position from 1st place to 5th place.\nSince the order of ranking is important, we need to determine how many different ways the top five positions can be arranged. This follows the permutation rule, as once a country‚Äôs submission is assigned a position, it cannot be placed elsewhere. The total number of possible rankings is calculated as: \\[5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5! = 120 \\]\nThus, there are 120 possible ways to assign the final rankings to the five finalists.\nThis follows the principle of permutations without replacement, meaning that each finalist is placed in a unique ranking, and no two countries can hold the same position.\n\n\n\n10.1.4 Drawing without Replacement, Ignoring Order\n\nExample 9.7: Poker Hands üé¥\nIn a standard game of five-card poker, a player is dealt five random cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Since:\n\nThe order of the cards does not matter (a hand with A‚ô† K‚ô† Q‚ô† J‚ô† 10‚ô† is the same regardless of the order drawn).\nCards are drawn without replacement (once a card is drawn, it cannot be selected again), we calculate the total number of different poker hands using combinations without replacement: \\[\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52!}{(52-5)!5!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5!} = 2 598 960 \\]\nThus, there are 2 598 960 unique five-card poker hands in a standard deck.\n\nWhat is the probability of getting a flush on the first draw?\nA flush in poker means that all five cards in the hand belong to the same suit (‚ô†, ‚ô•, ‚ô¶, or ‚ô£). We define event \\(A\\) as the event of being dealt a flush directly, meaning that all five cards in the hand belong to the same suit (‚ô†, ‚ô•, ‚ô¶, or ‚ô£).\nTo compute the probability \\(A\\), consider that:\n\nIf we focus on only hearts, there are 13 hearts in the deck, and we need to choose 5 of them: \\[\\binom{13}{5} = \\frac{13!}{(13-5)!5!} = 1287 \\]\nThe same calculation applies for the other three suits (spades, diamonds, and clubs), so the total number of flush hands is: \\[4 \\times 1287 = 5148 \\]\n\nSince all poker hands are equally likely, the probability of being dealt a flush is: \\[P(A) = \\frac{5148}{2598960} \\approx 0.00198\\]\nThis means that the probability of being dealt a flush on the first draw is approximately 0.198%.",

    "text": "11.3 Conditional Probability\nImagine you‚Äôre waiting for a pizza delivery. Normally, the probability of the delivery driver being on time (event \\(B\\)) might not be great. But then you receive a text message saying, ‚ÄúYour order is on the way!‚Äù (event \\(A\\) has occurred). Now that you have extra information, your estimate of \\(P(B)\\) should change, right? That‚Äôs the essence of conditional probability; updating what we know when we gain new insight.\nWe originally wanted to find the probability of \\(B\\) happening, i.e., \\(P(B)\\). But now we‚Äôve been given a game-changing update: \\(A\\) has happened. That means our world is now limited to the subset of outcomes where \\(A\\) is true. In other words, we‚Äôre no longer looking at the whole sample space \\(\\Omega\\) - our new reality is just \\(A\\)!\nSo, the updated probability of \\(B\\) given that \\(A\\) has occurred, the so called conditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\), written as \\(P(B \\mid A)\\), is calculated using:\n\\[\nP(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(P(A) &gt; 0\\) (because if \\(A\\) didn‚Äôt happen, there‚Äôs no reason to update anything). This formula quantifies how the probability of \\(B\\) changes when we have additional information that \\(A\\) has occurred.\nConditional probability is like getting insider information:\n\nDid your team win the game? If they were leading at halftime, the probability changes.\n\nIs your package arriving today? If it was shipped yesterday, chances are better.\n\nAre you likely to pass your exam? If you‚Äôve studied, your odds are much higher!\n\nExample 11.3: Conditional Probability\nWe are given a population of individuals where:\n\n40% are men\n\n60% are women\n\nFurthermore, we know that:\n\n28% of the population are smokers, of which 8% are male and 20% are female\n\nA person is randomly selected from the population.\nWe are interested in finding the following conditional probabilities:\n\nWhat is the probability that the person is a smoker, given that the person is male?\nWhat is the probability that the person is a smoker, given that the person is female?\nWhat is the probability that the person is female, given that the person is a smoker?\n\nWe define the following events:\n\n\n\\(A\\): the person is a woman\n\n\n\\(\\bar{A}\\): the person is a man\n\n\n\\(B\\): the person is a smoker\n\n\n\\(\\bar{B}\\): the person is a non-smoker\n\nand the probabilities given for the events:\n\n\\(P(A) = 0.6\\)\n\\(P(\\bar{A}) = 0.4\\)\n\\(P(B) = 0.28\\)\n\\(P(\\bar{B}) = 0.72\\)\n\\(P(A \\cap B) = 0.20\\)\n\\(P(\\bar{A} \\cap B) = 0.08\\)\n\nTo help us calculate conditional probabilities, we construct a contingency table that shows joint and marginal probabilities. We fill in the parts given to us:\n\n\n\nWoman (\\(A\\))\nMan (\\(\\bar{A}\\))\nTotal\n\n\n\nSmoker (\\(B\\))\n0.20\n0.08\n0.28\n\n\nNon-smoker (\\(\\bar{B}\\))\n?\n?\n0.72\n\n\nTotal\n0.60\n0.40\n1.00\n\n\n\nTo fill in the remaining cells, we use subtraction: \\[P(A \\cap \\bar{B}) = P(A) - P(A \\cap B) = 0.60 - 0.20 = 0.40\\] \\[P(\\bar{A} \\cap \\bar{B}) = P(\\bar{A}) - P(\\bar{A} \\cap B) = 0.40 - 0.08 = 0.32\\]\nThe complete table is then given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoman (\\(A\\))\nMan (\\(\\bar{A}\\))\nTotal\n\n\n\nSmoker (\\(B\\))\n0.20\n0.08\n0.28\n\n\nNon-smoker (\\(\\bar{B}\\))\n0.40\n0.32\n0.72\n\n\nTotal\n0.60\n0.40\n1.00\n\n\n\nWith the help of this table, and the equation for conditional probability above, we can now find the asked probabilities (a)‚Äì(c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoker given man:\\[P(B \\mid \\bar{A}) = \\frac{P(B \\cap \\bar{A})}{P(\\bar{A})}\n= \\frac{0.08}{0.40} = 0.2\\] So, the probability that a person is a smoker given that he is a man is 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (b)\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoker given woman: \\[\n   P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.60} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (c)\n\n\n\n\n\nWoman given smoker: \\[\n   P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.28} \\approx 0.714\n\\]",

    "text": "11.6 The Law of Total Probability\nSometimes, we want to calculate the probability of a complex event \\(B\\), but it‚Äôs hard to compute directly. However, we might know the conditional probabilities of \\(B\\) given simpler events: \\(P(B \\mid A_1), P(B \\mid A_2), ..., P(B \\mid A_k)\\)\nIf \\(A_1, A_2, ..., A_k\\) are:\n\n\nmutually exclusive: \\(A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset\\) for \\(i \\ne j\\)\n\n\ncollectively exhaustive: \\(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_k = S\\)\n\n\nThen we can piece things together with the Law of Total Probability.\nLet \\(A_1, A_2, ..., A_k\\) be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events. Then:\n\\[\nP(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} P(A_i) \\cdot P(B \\mid A_i)\n\\]\nWe break down \\(B\\) based on each case \\(A_i\\), multiply by the probability of that case, then add them all up. Think of it like calculating total outcomes across different ‚Äúpaths‚Äù or scenarios. This is illustrated in Figure¬†11.5 for \\(k=7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11.5: Venn diagram of the law of total. probability\n\n\n\nExample 11.6: Picking Pupils\nThere are 3 school classes:\n\nClass 1: 10 boys, 10 girls\n\nClass 2: 8 boys, 12 girls\n\nClass 3: 6 boys, 14 girls\n\nA class is chosen at random, then a pupil is picked randomly from that class. What‚Äôs the probability the pupil is a girl?\nTo solve this, we define the following events:\n\n\n\\(A_1\\) = Class 1\n\n\n\\(A_2\\) = Class 2\n\n\n\\(A_3\\) = Class 3\n\n\n\\(B\\) = Student is a girl\n\nSince all classes are equally likely we get the following: \\[P(A_1) = P(A_2) = P(A_3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\\[P(B \\mid A_1) = \\frac{10}{20} = 0.5\\] \\[P(B \\mid A_2) = \\frac{12}{20} = 0.6\\] \\[P(B \\mid A_3) = \\frac{14}{20} = 0.7\\]\nNow we apply the law of total probability:\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0.5 + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0.6 + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0.7 = \\frac{0.5 + 0.6 + 0.7}{3} = \\frac{1.8}{3} = 0.6\n\\]\nThus, there‚Äôs a 60% chance the selected pupil is a girl.\nExample 11.7: Drawing Balls ‚ö´‚ö™\nYou can also illustrate the law of total probability using tree diagrams, which is used in this example. Assume draw two balls without replacement from a box of 7 black and 10 white balls.\nThe tree below illustrates the four possible outcomes of the two draws, along with their probabilities.\n\n\n\nTree\nStart\nStartA\nAP(A) = 7/17Start-&gt;A\n7/17Abar\nAÃÑP(AÃÑ) = 10/17Start-&gt;Abar\n10/17AB\nBP(B|A) = 6/16A-&gt;AB\n6/16ABarB\nBÃÑP(BÃÑ|A) = 10/16A-&gt;ABarB\n10/16AbarB\nBP(B|AÃÑ) = 7/16Abar-&gt;AbarB\n7/16AbarBarB\nBÃÑP(BÃÑ|AÃÑ) = 9/16Abar-&gt;AbarBarB\n9/16AB_lbl\nP(A)¬∑P(B|A)ABarB_lbl\nP(A)¬∑P(BÃÑ|A)AbarB_lbl\nP(AÃÑ)¬∑P(B|AÃÑ)AbarBarB_lbl\nP(AÃÑ)¬∑P(BÃÑ|AÃÑ)\n\n\n\nWe clarify each step now. Let:\n\n\n\\(A\\) = First ball is black\n\n\n\\(\\bar{A}\\) = First ball is white\n\n\n\\(B\\) = Second ball is black\n\nWe want to compute \\(P(B)\\) using total probability. First, we calculate each part:\n\\[P(A) = \\frac{7}{17}\\] since 7 out of 17 are black, and the complement is thus \\[P(\\bar{A}) = \\frac{10}{17}\\]\nIf the first is black we have that \\(P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{6}{16}\\), and one black is removed. If the first is white \\(P(B \\mid \\bar{A}) = \\frac{7}{16}\\), and all black balls are still there.\nNow apply the law of total probability:\n\\[\nP(B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B \\mid A) + P(\\bar{A}) \\cdot P(B \\mid \\bar{A})\n\\]\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{7}{17} \\cdot \\frac{6}{16} + \\frac{10}{17} \\cdot \\frac{7}{16}\n\\]\nSome simplifying leads to: \\[\nP(B) = \\frac{42}{272} + \\frac{70}{272} = \\frac{112}{272} = \\frac{7}{17}\n\\]\nThe probability of the second ball being black is again \\(\\frac{7}{17}\\); the same as the original proportion of black balls!",

Given the room, the conditional probabilities of finding the bathroom are:\n\n\n\\(P(T \\mid R_1) = 1/2\\)\n\n\n\\(P(T \\mid R_2) = 1/4\\)\n\n\\(P(T \\mid R_3) = 2/3\\)\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we compute:\n\\[\nP(T) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\n= \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{2}{9}\n= \\frac{6}{36} + \\frac{3}{36} + \\frac{8}{36} = \\frac{17}{36} \\approx 0.472\n\\]\nSo you have approximately a 47.2% chance of finding the bathroom.\n\n\n\n\nYou found the bathroom, but which room did you use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs now suppose you did find the bathroom but forgot which room you entered first. What‚Äôs the probability you entered through say room \\(R_2\\)?\nThis is another great application of Bayes‚Äô Theorem. We now want \\(P(R_2 \\mid T)\\), the probability that you passed through \\(R_2\\) given that you found the bathroom.\nAccording to Bayes‚Äô Theorem:\n\\[\nP(R_2 \\mid T) = \\frac{P(R_2) \\cdot P(T \\mid R_2)}{P(T)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{17}{36}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\cdot \\frac{36}{17} = \\frac{3}{17} \\approx 0.176\n\\]\nSo there‚Äôs about a 17.6% chance that your successful journey to the bathroom started through \\(R_2\\). Similarly: \\[\nP(R_1 \\mid T) =  \\frac{P(R_1) \\cdot P(T \\mid R_1)}{P(T)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{17}{36}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{36}{17} = \\frac{6}{17} \\approx 0.353\n\\] and \\[\nP(R_3 \\mid T) = \\frac{P(R_3) \\cdot P(T \\mid R_3)}{P(T)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{17}{36}} = \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{36}{17} = \\frac{8}{17} \\approx 0.471\n\\]",

    "text": "12.1 What is a Random Variable?\nIn statistics, sampling should always be done randomly. This means that before the sampling occurs, we do not know who will be selected; it‚Äôs a random experiment where all individuals in the population are possible outcomes.\nTo introduce the idea of a random variable (also called a stochastic variable), imagine a small population of six individuals: Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Erin, Finn. This is shown in Figure¬†12.1 (a).\nWe are not primarily interested in the individuals themselves, but in the values they hold on some variable. For example, suppose we want to study whether each person has a driver‚Äôs license. Let‚Äôs assign a value of 1 to those who have a license and 0 to those who don‚Äôt. Now, instead of thinking about names, our outcome space transforms into a set of 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs, depending on the presence or absence of a driver‚Äôs license. This is shown in Figure¬†12.1 (b).\nIn probability theory, we often want to describe a random experiment using a variable before the experiment is carried out. Because we do not know in advance what the outcome will be, we use a random variable to represent the result. This variable is typically denoted by a capital letter, such as \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), or \\(Z\\), often chosen from the end of the alphabet.\nFor example, we might define the variable \\(X\\) as:\n\\(X\\) = Number of people with a driver‚Äôs license\nThis variable can take on different values depending on who is selected during the sampling process. By grouping all individuals who share the same outcome value for our variable, we divide the outcome space into disjoint events. Suppose we define the event \\(A\\) as: ‚ÄúA randomly selected individual has a driver‚Äôs license.‚Äù\nThis allows us to split the outcome space into two distinct parts: those with \\(X = 1\\) (event \\(A\\)), and those with \\(X = 0\\) (event \\(\\bar{A}\\)), as shown in Figure¬†12.2.\nIf three of the six individuals in the population have a license, then the probability of selecting a person with a license is:\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5\n\\]\nAnd the probability of selecting someone without a license is:\n\\[\nP(X = 0) = \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5\n\\]\nThis defines the probability distribution of the variable \\(X\\). Note that we can construct an infinite number of random variables for the same random experiment. For instance, if we use the same group of six people, we could define a new variable \\(X\\) to represent vaccination instead of license status. Then we would need to specify what values the variable takes (e.g., 1 = vaccinated, 0 = not vaccinated), define the corresponding event \\(A\\), and determine the resulting probability distribution for this new version of \\(X\\).\nOnce the random event has occurred and the experiment is completed, the stochastic variable will have assumed a specific value. At that point, we switch notation and use lowercase letters (such as \\(x\\), \\(y\\), or \\(z\\)) to refer to the observed values. We write \\(P(x) = P(X = x)\\), which defines the probability function for the variable \\(X\\). This function tells us the likelihood that \\(X\\) takes on specific values \\(x\\).\nIn summary, a random variable is a numerical variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random experiment. Before the experiment is performed, we don‚Äôt know what value the variable will take, but we do know the set of possible values it may assume. Once the experiment is conducted, the variable takes on a definite value, and we can analyze its behavior using its probability distribution.\nWe use uppercase letters like \\(X\\) to denote random variables, and the corresponding lowercase letters (like \\(x\\)) to represent actual outcomes. Depending on the context, random variables may be discrete or continuous, and each has its own type of probability model.",
