# Estimation {#sec-est}
When working with data, we often face the challenge of estimating unknown characteristics of a population based on a limited set of observations: a sample. These characteristics could be the population mean ($\mu$), the population proportion ($p$), or the population variance ($\sigma^2$), among others. In general, we denote the unknown population parameter we wish to estimate by $\theta$.

Suppose we collect a random sample consisting of $n$ independent observations, denoted by $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$. Based on this sample, we compute an estimate of $\theta$, which we denote as $\hat{\theta}$. For instance, if the parameter of interest is the population mean $\mu$, then the corresponding estimate is the sample mean $\bar{X}$. If the parameter of interest is the population variance $\sigma^2$, the estimate is the sample variance $s^2$.

Because the sample is randomly drawn from the population, the estimate $\hat{\theta}$ is itself a random variable. Its value depends on the specific observations in the sample, and therefore it varies from sample to sample. The distribution of this estimate across many repeated samples is known as its sampling distribution (see @sec-sampldist-mean and @sec-sampldist-prop). Understanding the behavior of this distribution is central to inferential statistics: it allows us to assess the uncertainty in our estimates and build confidence intervals, conduct hypothesis tests, and more.

Naturally, we hope that the value of our estimate $\hat{\theta}$ is close to the true, unknown value of $\theta$. However, there is always a degree of uncertainty involved. To evaluate the quality of an estimator, we study its properties, most importantly, its expected value and its variance.



## Estimators, Estimate, Estimands

For clarity, it's important to distinguish between three closely related but conceptually distinct terms in inferential statistics: **estimand**, **estimator**, and **estimate**.

- **Estimand**: This is the **target** of our inference—the unknown quantity or parameter in the population we want to learn about. Examples include the population mean $\mu$, the proportion of voters supporting a policy $p$, or the difference in means between two groups $\mu_1 - \mu_2$.

- **Estimator**: A formula or rule that we apply to sample data in order to make an informed guess about the estimand. It is a **random variable**, as it depends on the data, which in turn vary across samples. For instance, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is an estimator for the population mean $\mu$.

- **Estimate**: The **actual numerical result** obtained when we apply the estimator to a specific dataset. It is a **fixed number**, not a random variable. For example, if $\bar{X} = 7.4$ from our sample, then 7.4 is our estimate of the population mean.

In simpler terms:

| Term       | Role                            | Example                   |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Estimand   | What we want to know             | $\mu$, $p$, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ |
| Estimator  | How we calculate it              | $\bar{X}$, $\hat{p}$      |
| Estimate   | What we get from our data        | 7.4, 0.38                 |

> ⚠️ While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably in casual discussion, understanding their formal distinction is crucial for clear statistical reasoning.

In this text, we may occasionally use "estimate" loosely, but rest assured; we’ll always be clear about what we're inferring, how we're doing it, and what the result actually tells us.


## Properties of Estimators
An estimator's quality is assessed through certain desirable properties. The most fundamental ones are **unbiasedness**, **consistency**, and **efficiency**.

An estimator $\hat{\theta}$ is called **unbiased** if its expected value equals the true parameter:

$$
E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta.
$$

This means that, on average across many samples, the estimator hits the correct value. If this condition is not met, the estimator is said to have a **bias**, defined as:

$$
\text{Bias}(\hat{\theta}) = E(\hat{\theta}) - \theta.
$$

An estimator with zero bias is called unbiased. But just being correct *on average* is not enough. We also want our estimator to be **reliable**, that is, to give values that are close to the true parameter in most samples, not just on average.

This brings us to the property of **consistency**. An estimator is **consistent** if it gets arbitrarily close to the true parameter as the sample size increases. Formally, a consistent estimator $\hat{\theta}_n$ satisfies:

$$
\hat{\theta}_n \xrightarrow{p} \theta \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
$$

That is, the probability that the estimator deviates substantially from $\theta$ goes to zero as the number of observations grows. Consistency ensures long-run accuracy with enough data.

Finally, among several unbiased and consistent estimators, we may prefer the one that tends to stay closest to the target in each sample. This is the idea behind **efficiency**. An estimator is more efficient if it has smaller variance among all unbiased estimators. In practical terms, this means it's more **precise**: it fluctuates less from sample to sample, producing estimates tightly clustered around the true value. When comparing two unbiased estimators of the same parameter, the one with the smaller variance is considered more efficient. 

To illustrate these concepts, consider the dartboard image below:

::: center
![Each board illustrates a combination of estimator characteristics. The bottom-left shows an unbiased and efficient estimator (tight clustering at the center). The top-left is biased but efficient (tight clustering, but off-target). The bottom-right is unbiased but inefficient (centered but scattered). The top-right represents an inefficient and biased estimator (wide scatter, off-target). This analogy helps visualize bias, precision, and the ideal goal of consistency over repeated samples.](imgs/dart.png){#fig-dart fig-align="center" width="70%"}
:::


Together, these properties give us a clear framework for evaluating the reliability of estimators. Ideally, we want an estimator that is unbiased and has the smallest possible variance, a combination that yields both accuracy and precision in estimation.




## Point Estimation

In statistical inference, we often aim to estimate unknown characteristics of a population—such as its average income, the proportion of voters in favor of a policy, or the variance in housing prices. This process of using data from a sample to calculate a single value as a “best guess” for a population parameter is known as **point estimation**.

Let us assume we have a random sample $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ of $n$ independent observations from a population with an unknown mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. A **point estimator** is a function of the sample data used to estimate a population parameter.

For instance:

- The **population mean** $\mu$ is typically estimated by the **sample mean** $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$
- The **population proportion** $p$ is estimated by the **sample proportion** $\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n}$, where $x$ is the number of "successes"
- The **population variance** $\sigma^2$ is estimated by the **sample variance** $s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2$

These estimators are derived from the data and yield a specific number once we collect our sample. However, prior to observing the data, the estimator is a random variable because it depends on the randomly selected sample.

Since estimators are functions of random samples, they too follow a probability distribution. This distribution is known as the sampling distribution of the estimator (see @sec-sampldist-mean and @sec-sampldist-prop). It tells us how the estimator would vary if we repeatedly took samples of the same size from the same population.

A crucial insight here is that the larger the sample size, the less variability the estimator will show across repeated samples, leading to more **reliable** estimation.

Understanding the quality of an estimator involves examining the theoretical properties mentioned above:

- **Unbiasedness**: An estimator $\hat{\theta}$ is said to be **unbiased** for a parameter $\theta$ if its expected value equals the true parameter:  
  $$ E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta $$

  For example (this was shown in detail in @sec-sampldist-mean):
  - $E(\bar{X}) = \mu$, so the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean.
  - $E(\hat{p}) = p$, meaning the sample proportion is also unbiased for the true proportion.
  - $E(s^2) = \sigma^2$, making $s^2$ an unbiased estimator of the population variance.

  *(Note: The sample standard deviation $s$ is not an unbiased estimator of $\sigma$.)*

- **Variance**: The **spread** of the estimator’s sampling distribution is captured by its variance. Smaller variance means the estimator tends to be closer to the true parameter.

  For the sample mean, this is given by:  
  $$ \operatorname{Var}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} $$  
  Similarly, for the sample proportion:
  $$ \operatorname{Var}(\hat{p}) = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n} $$

  These expressions show that increasing the sample size $n$ decreases the variance of the estimator.

- **Standard Error**: The **standard deviation** of an estimator’s sampling distribution is called the **standard error** (SE). It quantifies how much the estimator would vary from sample to sample:
  $$ \text{SE}(\bar{X}) = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}}, \quad \text{SE}(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} $$

In practice, when $\sigma^2$ or $p$ are unknown, we often substitute their estimates.


Point estimation provides an intuitive way to infer unknown quantities in a population using observed sample data. It’s the first essential tool in the inferential statistics toolbox, allowing us to move from descriptive summaries to educated guesses about the world beyond our data. In the coming chapters, we will build on these estimators to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing, all grounded in the probabilistic behavior of these sampling distributions.

## Interval Estimation

In statistics, a single number, known as a point estimate, can give us an estimate of a population parameter, like the mean. But such an estimate tells us little about how precise or reliable it is. After all, due to the randomness inherent in sampling, our estimate could vary from sample to sample. That’s why we turn to **interval estimation**.

A **confidence interval** provides a range of plausible values for the unknown parameter. It gives a way to quantify the uncertainty of our point estimate. The general form of a confidence interval can be written as:

$$
\text{Point Estimate} \pm \text{Margin of Error}
$$

More formally, a confidence interval is constructed so that, with a specified probability known as the **confidence level**, contains the true value of the parameter. This probability is denoted by $1 - \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the **significance level**. Common choices are 95% confidence ($\alpha = 0.05$) or 99% confidence ($\alpha = 0.01$). The higher the confidence level, the wider the interval must be to ensure it covers the true parameter more frequently in repeated samples.

While a point estimate gives us a single best guess for the value of a population parameter, it offers no information about the uncertainty of that guess. This is visualized in @fig-fish. Imagine you’re trying to catch a fish (think *parameter*) you can’t quite see. Point estimation is like throwing a spear: accurate if you hit, but there's a good chance you'll miss. Interval estimation is more forgiving: it's like casting a net. You may not catch the exact center, but you're much more likely to get the fish. This is exactly what confidence intervals offer: a wider, more reliable shot at capturing the truth.

### Confidence Interval for the Population Mean
When we talk about a **confidence interval** for the population mean $\mu$ with a **confidence level** of 95%, we mean an interval that, in the long run, will contain the true value of $\mu$ in 95% of repeated samples. In practice, we never know the true mean, but we use our sample data to construct a range where we believe the mean is likely to lie.

More precisely, the endpoints of the interval (called the *Lower Confidence Limit* (LCL) and *Upper Confidence Limit* (UCL)) are calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{LCL} &= \bar{X} - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \\
\text{UCL} &= \bar{X} + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

For a 95% confidence level, the critical value is $z_{\alpha/2} \approx 1.96$.


Before we observe any data, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is a random variable. If the population is **normally distributed with known variance $\sigma^2$**, then:

$$
\bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})
$$

Standardizing gives:

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

We know (from @sec-normaltbl):

$$
P(-1.96 \leq Z \leq 1.96) = 0.95
$$

Rewriting this inequality in terms of $\mu$:

$$
P\left(\underbrace{\bar{X} - 1.96 \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}_{\text{LCL}} \leq \mu \leq  \underbrace{\bar{X} + 1.96 \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}_{\text{UCL}}\right) = 0.95
$$

This tells us that if we repeat this sampling process many times, 95% of the resulting intervals will contain the true population mean. This is visualized in @fig-cfi.

In both cases, the central 95% of the distribution is shaded, with $\alpha/2 = 0.025$ in each tail, and the total area between the bounds representing 95% probability.
:::

Each time we draw a new sample from a population and construct a confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$, the endpoints of that interval are random; they depend on the data from that specific sample. This means that the interval can change from sample to sample. However, if we use a 95% confidence level, then in the long run, 95% of those intervals will capture the true mean, and 5% will not.

In other words, we can’t guarantee that a single confidence interval contains the population mean, but we can say that the method used to construct it is correct 95% of the time. To show this, we perform a simulation: we simulate 100 samples from the same population, construct a 95% confidence interval for each, and visualizes which ones do and do not include the true population mean. Each vertical line in  @fig-cfi-sim represents one confidence interval from a sample of size $n = 30$. The blue line shows the true mean $\mu = 5$ and. The grey intervals contain the true mean, as expected 95% of the time. Red intervals are the $\approx$5% that miss, a natural consequence of statistical variation.

So how do we interpret the confidence interval? Before we collect any data, we can say that there is a 95% probability that the interval we are about to compute will contain the true population mean, $\mu$. This probability statement refers to the process, not the specific interval. That is, we are 95% confident in the method, not in any one result. Once a sample is drawn and the confidence interval is computed, the situation changes. The interval is now fixed, it either contains $\mu$ or it doesn’t. We no longer speak of probabilities regarding this specific interval. However, what we do know is this:

> The interval was calculated using a procedure that, in the long run, produces intervals that contain the true mean in 95% of all cases.

This is the essence of the frequentist interpretation of confidence intervals. It doesn’t tell us the probability that our specific interval contains $\mu$, but it does provide a measure of trust in the procedure we used to create it. That’s why we refer to it as a “confidence” interval — not because we are certain, but because we have reason to be confident based on the method’s performance over repeated samples.

So far, we have only constructed 95% confidence intervals for a population mean. This means that if we were to repeat the sampling procedure many times, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean, $\mu$.

But 95% is not a fixed rule. We can choose other confidence levels—such as 90% or 99%—depending on how certain we want to be. The trade-off is that a *higher level* of confidence results in a *wider interval*, while a *lower confidence level* gives a *narrower but less certain estimate*.

When the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known and the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal (either by assumption or via the Central Limit Theorem), the general structure of a confidence interval for the mean is:

$$
\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

where:

- $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean  
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation  
- $n$ is the sample size  
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for the desired confidence level


Some common confidence levels and their corresponding $z$-values are shown in @tbl-cflevels (see @sec-normaltbl for the exact values):

::: {#tbl-cflevels}

| Confidence Level | $\alpha$ | $z_{\alpha/2}$ |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| 90%              | 0.10     | 1.645          |
| 95%              | 0.05     | 1.960          |
| 99%              | 0.01     | 2.576          |

Commonly used confidence levels and their corresponding critical values from the standard normal distribution. The value $z_{\alpha/2}$ represents the point such that the area between $-z_{\alpha/2}$ and $z_{\alpha/2}$ under the standard normal curve equals the stated confidence level.
:::

As seen in @fig-cfi-2, a higher confidence level (e.g., 99% instead of 95%) leads to a wider interval since the $z$ value moves further away from the center towards the tails, giving us more “certainty” at the cost of less precision. A larger sample size reduces the standard error $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, resulting in a narrower interval, i.e., better precision without sacrificing confidence.

The confidence interval spans the central $(1 - \alpha)$ area of the standard normal distribution. Each tail has area $\alpha/2$.

This approach provides a principled way of capturing the uncertainty in our estimation of $\mu$. While the point estimate $\bar{X}$ gives our best guess, the confidence interval gives us a sense of how variable that estimate might be if we repeated the experiment.


In the following, we continue to build on this framework and explore how confidence intervals can be constructed for other types of parameters and under various assumptions.


#### Example 21.1: Confidence Interval for a Population Mean {.unnumbered}
Let's consider a scenario where we take a random sample of size $n = 25$ from a normally distributed population. Suppose we know the population standard deviation to be $\sigma = 15$, and the sample mean is $\bar{x} = 102$.

We want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$. We use the formula for a confidence interval when the population standard deviation is known:

$$
\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

For a 95% confidence level, the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.025} = 1.96$.

Let's plug in the values:

$$
102 \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{15}{\sqrt{25}} = 102 \pm 1.96 \cdot 3 = 102 \pm 5.88
$$

Hence, the 95% confidence interval becomes:

$$
(96.12,\ 107.88)
$$

This interval suggests that if we were to repeat this sampling process many times, approximately 95% of the resulting intervals would contain the true population mean $\mu$.

*What if we want a 99% confidence interval?*
A higher confidence level requires a larger critical value. For 99% confidence, we use $z_{0.005} = 2.575$. Applying the formula:

$$
102 \pm 2.575 \cdot \frac{15}{\sqrt{25}} = 102 \pm 2.575 \cdot 3 = 102 \pm 7.725
$$

This results in a wider interval:

$$
(94.275,\ 109.725)
$$

As expected, increasing the confidence level results in a wider interval. This reflects greater certainty, more room is allowed to ensure the true mean is captured.


#### Confidence Intervals with Unknown Variance {.unnumbered}

In previous examples, we constructed confidence intervals assuming that the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known and that the population is normally distributed. While this is convenient for illustrating the basic logic of confidence intervals, it is rarely the case in practice.

>But what if $\sigma$ is unknown?

When $\sigma$ is **unknown**, we typically rely on the **sample standard deviation** $s$ instead. This introduces an additional source of uncertainty because we are now estimating both the center ($\bar{X}$) and the spread ($s$) from the sample data.

As a result, our confidence interval becomes wider, especially when the sample size $n$ is small. To account for this, we use the **$t$-distribution** rather than the standard normal distribution.

We distinguish between two scenarios:

**1.	Large sample size ($n \geq 30$):**

When the sample size is large, the Central Limit Theorem (@sec-clt) ensures that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal, even if the population isn’t. In this case, substituting $s$ for $\sigma$ has little impact, and we can still use the normal approximation:
$$
\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}.
$$

**2.	Small sample size ($n < 30$):**

When the sample size is small and $\sigma$ is unknown, we must use the $t$-distribution with $\nu = n-1$ degrees of freedom:

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{\nu, \alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}.
$$

Here, $t_{\nu, \alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the $t$-distribution that corresponds to the desired confidence level. This values is obtained from @sec-ttbl and is fully determined by the degrees of freedom $\nu$ and confidence level $\alpha$.

::: {.callout-note}
## Introducing the $t$-distribution {.unnumbered}

The **Student’s $t$-distribution** is a fundamental tool in statistics when estimating a population mean from a small sample, especially in cases where the **population standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown**. While it resembles the standard normal distribution $N(0, 1)$ in shape, the $t$-distribution has heavier tails. These heavier tails reflect the added uncertainty introduced by estimating $\sigma$ with the sample standard deviation $s$.

The exact shape of the $t$-distribution depends on its **degrees of freedom**, typically $\nu = n - 1$, where $n$ is the sample size. As the sample size increases, the estimate of $\sigma$ becomes more reliable, and the $t$-distribution gradually approaches the normal distribution. In fact, as $\nu \to \infty$, the $t$-distribution converges to $N(0, 1)$ (see @fig-tz-dist).

When the population is normally distributed and we collect a random sample of size $n$, the following standardized statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom:

$$
\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t(n - 1)
$$

This formulation allows us to perform valid inference about the population mean $\mu$, even without knowing the true standard deviation $\sigma$, as long as the population itself is assumed to be normally distributed.

#### Summary: Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean  {.unnumbered}

When constructing a confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$, the formula depends on three key factors:  

- whether the population standard deviation $σ$ is known,  
- the size of the sample, and  
- whether the population is normally distributed.

@tbl-popmean-cfi below summarizes which distribution and formula to use in different situations:

Summary of conditions for constructing confidence intervals for a population mean.

> Note: If the sample size is small ($n < 30$) and the population is **not** normally distributed, we cannot safely use these formulas to calculate a confidence interval for $\mu$. In such cases, resampling methods like bootstrapping or non-parametric approaches may be more appropriate.



#### Example 21.2:  Confidence Interval for a Population Mean, $n$ small, variance unknown {.unnumbered}

In a laboratory, measurements are taken on a variable that is assumed to be normally distributed. On one occasion, 12 measurements are obtained, resulting in:

- $\bar{x} = 9.6$  
- $s = 1.89$

We are asked to compute a 95% confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$.

Since we have a small sample size ($n = 12$) and the population variance $\sigma^2$ is unknown, we use the **Student's t-distribution** with $n - 1 = 11$ degrees of freedom. The general formula for the confidence interval is:

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{\nu, \alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

For a 95% confidence level, $\alpha = 0.05$, so $\alpha/2 = 0.025$. From the $t$-distribution table @sec-ttbl, we find:

$$
t_{11, 0.025} = 2.201
$$

We can now compute the confidence interval bounds as follows. 

$$
\bar{x} \pm 2.201 \cdot \frac{1.89}{\sqrt{12}} = 9.6 \pm 2.201 \cdot 0.545
$$

$$
9.6 \pm 1.20
$$

Thus, the 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ is:

$$
[8.40,\ 10.80]
$$

We can say that the true population mean $\mu$ lies between 8.40 and 10.80 with 95% confidence. This means that if we were to repeat this sampling process many times, approximately 95% of the constructed confidence intervals would contain the true mean.

### Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion
Just as we can construct a confidence interval for a population mean, we can also build one for a proportion. This is particularly useful when dealing with categorical data, for instance, estimating the proportion of defective units in a production process or the share of voters supporting a candidate.

Let $p$ denote the **population proportion**, that is, the true (but unknown) share of the population with a specific characteristic. As before,
we estimate $p$ using the **sample proportion** $\hat{p}$, defined as:

$$
\hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of observations with the characteristic}}{n}
$$

This is the point estimate of $p$. Under random sampling, this estimator is **unbiased**, meaning:

$$
E(\hat{p}) = p
$$

The **variance** of $\hat{p}$ is:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{p}) = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n}
$$

This was shown in detail in @sec-sampldist-prop. 

Since $p$ is unknown, we approximate this variance using the observed sample proportion:

$$
\widehat{\text{Var}}(\hat{p}) = \frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}
$$

When the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ can be approximated by a **normal distribution** (thanks to the Central Limit Theorem):

$$
\frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}} \overset{\text{apx}}{\sim} N(0, 1)
$$

This approximation holds well when the sample size satisfies the following rule of thumb: $np(1 - p) > 5$. If this condition is met, we can construct a confidence interval using the normal distribution.

The confidence interval for the population proportion $p$ is given by:

$$
\hat{p} \pm \underbrace{z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} }_{\text{margin of error}}
$$
The value of $z_{\alpha/2}$ depends on the desired confidence level, just as before shown in @tbl-cflevels.

To estimate a population proportion using confeidence intervals:

1. Compute the sample proportion $\hat{p}$.
2. Calculate the standard error $\sqrt{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p}) / n}$.
3. Use the appropriate $z$-value for your confidence level.
4. Construct the interval using $\hat{p} \pm$ margin of error.

This method allows us to make probabilistic statements about the true population proportion, provided the sample size is sufficiently large.

::: {.callout-note}
## Note on the *t*-distribution and proportions

The *t*-distribution is **not** used for constructing confidence intervals for proportions, even when sample sizes are small. Proportions are based on the binomial distribution, and standard confidence intervals rely on the **normal approximation** when conditions are met. If these conditions aren’t satisfied, **exact methods** or **adjusted intervals** should be used instead.
:::


#### Example 21.3: Confidence Interval for a Proportion {.unnumbered}
We take a random sample of $n = 1200$ people from a large population. Of those sampled, 43.5% report supporting a certain political party. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion $p$ of the population who support the party.

We are given:

- $\hat{p} = 0.435$
- $n = 1200$
- Confidence level = 95% $\Rightarrow \alpha = 0.05$ $\Rightarrow z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96$

The confidence interval for a population proportion is calculated as:

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$\begin{split}
0.435 \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.435(1 - 0.435)}{1200}} 
& = 0.435 \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.245775}{1200}} \\
& = 0.435 \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{0.0002048} \\
& = 0.435 \pm 1.96 \cdot 0.0143  \\
& = 0.435 \pm 0.028 \\
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the 95% confidence interval is:

$$
[0.407,\ 0.463]
$$

This means we are 95% confident that the true proportion of supporters in the population lies between 40.7% and 46.3%.


## Exercises {.unnumbered}

1. A random sample of 120 families was drawn from a population of approximately 5000 families. The number of children in each selected family was recorded. The sample yielded $\bar{x} = 1.28$ (mean number of children)
and $s = 1.10$ (sample standard deviation). Assuming the sample is drawn using simple random sampling, calculate a 99% confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$, the average number of children per family.

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
## Solution

We are given:

- $\bar{x} = 1.28$
- $s = 1.10$
- $n = 120$
- Confidence level: $99\% \Rightarrow \alpha = 0.01 \Rightarrow \alpha/2 = 0.005$
- $z_{\alpha/2} = 2.58$ (from the standard normal table)

Since the sample is large ($n = 120$), the Central Limit Theorem applies, and we can use the normal distribution.

The standard error is:

$$
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.10}{\sqrt{120}} \approx 0.1004
$$

Then the confidence interval is:

$$
\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot SE = 1.28 \pm 2.58 \cdot 0.1004 \approx 1.28 \pm 0.26
$$

Final interval:

$$
[1.02,\ 1.54]
$$

Interpretation: We are 99% confident that the true mean number of children per family in the population lies between 1.02 and 1.54.
:::

2. In a small town with 8820 households, a sample of 200 households is taken. In the sample, 60 households have a smart home system installed. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of households in the entire town that have a smart home system.



::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
## Solution

We are given:

- $n = 200$
- $x = 60$
- $\hat{p} = \frac{60}{200} = 0.30$
- $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$ for a 95% confidence level

The standard error is calculated as:

$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.30(1 - 0.30)}{200}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.21}{200}} \approx 0.0324
$$

The confidence interval is:

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot SE = 0.30 \pm 1.96 \cdot 0.0324 \approx 0.30 \pm 0.0635
$$

So the 95% confidence interval is approximately:

$$
[0.24, 0.36]
$$

To interpret this in terms of number of households:

- $0.24 \cdot 8820 \approx 2117$
- $0.36 \cdot 8820 \approx 3175$

We can say, with 95% confidence, that roughly 2100 and 3200 households in the town have a smart home system installed.
