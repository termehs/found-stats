## Sampling Distributions for a Proportion {#sec-sampldist-prop}
In many applications, we are interested not in the mean of a variable, but in the **proportion** of units in a population that possess a certain characteristic — for example, the proportion of voters who support a candidate, or the proportion of products that are defective.



## The Proportion as a Random Variable
Let $p$ denote the true proportion in the population of units with a characteristic $A$. We consider two equivalent situations:

1. A random sample of size $n$ is drawn from a large (finite) population, where $p$ is the proportion of $A$-units.
2. We perform $n$ independent trials, each with probability $p$ of "success" (i.e., observing $A$). In this case, $X \sim \text{Bin}(n, p)$.

In both cases, we define the **sample proportion** as:

$$
\hat{p} = \frac{X}{n}
$$

where $X$ is the number of observed "successes" in the sample.

In fact, the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ can be viewed as a **sample mean of 0/1 variables**, where each observation equals 1 if the characteristic is present and 0 otherwise. 

##  Properties of the Sampling Distribution


Because $\hat{p}$ depends on the outcomes of a random process, it is itself a random variable. Its distribution is called the **sampling distribution of the sample proportion**.

This distribution describes how the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ would vary from sample to sample due to randomness.
Just like the sample mean, the sample proportion has a mean and variance:

- Expected value:
$$
E(\hat{p}) = p
$$

- Variance:
$$
\operatorname{Var}(\hat{p}) = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n}
$$

These results follow from properties of the binomial distribution (see @sec-binom). If $X \sim \text{Bin}(n, p)$, then:
$$
E(X) = np \quad \text{and} \quad \operatorname{Var}(X) = np(1 - p)
$$

Then:
$$
E\left(\frac{X}{n}\right) = \frac{E(X)}{n} = \frac{np}{n} =  p
$$
$$
\operatorname{Var}\left(\frac{X}{n}\right) = \frac{\operatorname{Var}(X)}{n^2} = \frac{np(1 - p)}{n^2} = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n}
$$

## Normal Approximation of the Sample Proportion
Under certain conditions, the distribution of $\hat{p}$ can be approximated by a normal distribution. This is particularly useful for calculating probabilities.

The approximation holds when the sample is sufficiently large. A common rule of thumb is:

$$
np(1 - p) > 5
$$

If this holds, we can write:

$$
\hat{p} \approx \mathcal{N}\left(p, \frac{p(1 - p)}{n}\right)
$$
This follows from the fact that the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ can be viewed as a sample mean of binary variables, justifying the use of **Central Limit Theorem** covered in the next chapter @sec-clt.


#### Example: 18.1: Electrical Installations in Old Houses {.unnumbered}
In a large population of older houses, 30% are known to have faulty electrical installations. We take a simple random sample of $n = 250$ houses.
What is the probability that the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ falls between 0.25 and 0.35?
Let's have a look at the given:

- True population proportion: $p = 0.30$
- Sample size: $n = 250$
- Target interval: $0.25 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.35$

Since we're dealing with a sample proportion, the random variable $\hat{p} = X/n$ has:

- Expected value: $E(\hat{p}) = p = 0.30$
- Variance: $\operatorname{Var}(\hat{p}) = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.7}{250} = 0.00084$
- Standard deviation (standard error): $\sqrt{0.00084} \approx 0.029$
We check:

$$
np(1 - p) = 250 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 52.5 > 5
$$

This confirms that we can approximate the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ using a normal distribution. Next, we standardize the bounds and convert 0.25 and 0.35 to $Z$-scores:

$$
Z_1 = \frac{0.25 - 0.30}{0.029} \approx -1.72 \\
Z_2 = \frac{0.35 - 0.30}{0.029} \approx 1.72
$$

Now the probaiblity area we seek is given by as shown in the plot below:
$$
P(0.25 \leq \hat{p} \leq 0.35) = P(-1.72 \leq Z \leq 1.72)
$$


```{r}
#| label: plot-shaded-normal
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4

library(ggplot2)

# Define Z range
z_vals <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 1000)
densities <- dnorm(z_vals)

df <- data.frame(z = z_vals, density = densities)

# Define shading range
shade_range <- subset(df, z >= -1.72 & z <= 1.72)

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = z, y = density)) +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 0.5) +
  geom_area(data = shade_range, aes(x = z, y = density), fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1.72, 1.72), linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +
  annotate("text", x = -1.72, y = 0.02, label = "-1.72", vjust = 1.5, hjust = 1.1) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.72, y = 0.02, label = "1.72", vjust = 1.5, hjust = -0.1) +
  labs(title = " ", x = "z", y = "f(z)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
  panel.grid = element_blank(),   
  panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA)       
)
```

From the standard normal table (@sec-normaltbl) we get
$$
\Phi(1.72) \approx 0.957,\quad \Phi(-1.72) \approx  1-\Phi(1.72)  = 0.043
$$

which implies that
$$
P(-1.72 \leq Z \leq 1.72) = 0.957 - 0.043 = 0.914
$$
In conclusion, there is about a 91% probability that the sample proportion will fall between 25% and 35%. This reflects the natural variability of proportions in random samples, and highlights how the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ allows us to make probabilistic statements about sample outcomes.

## Exercises {.unnumbered}

1. A political poll finds that 55% of voters in a population support a new environmental policy. A journalist takes a random sample of 200 people from the population. What is the probability that fewer than the majority in the sample supports the policy?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
We seek the probability that the sample proportion is less than 0.5, that is $P(\hat{p} \leq 0.5)$. We are given:

- $p = 0.55$
- $n = 200$

Check conditions:
$$
np(1 - p) = 200 \cdot 0.55 \cdot 0.45 = 49.5 > 5 \quad \text{so we can use normal approx.}
$$

Standard error:
$$
\text{SE} = \sqrt{ \frac{0.55 \cdot 0.45}{200} } \approx 0.035
$$

Standardize:
$$
Z = \frac{0.50 - 0.55}{0.035} \approx -1.43
$$

$$
P(\hat{p} \leq 0.50) = P(\hat{p} < 0.50) = P(Z < -1.43) \approx 0.0764
$$

There’s about a 7.6% chance the sample shows less than 50% support.

2. In a large batch of manufactured items, 4% are defective. An inspector takes a sample of 100 items. What is the probability that more than 5% of the sample is defective?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
Given:

- $p = 0.04$
- $n = 100$

Check:
$$
np(1 - p) = 100 \cdot 0.04 \cdot 0.96 = 3.84 \lt 5 \quad \text{not large enough for normal approx.}
$$

The normal approximation should not be used here. Use exact binomial calculation instead:

$$
P(X > 5) = 1 - P(X \leq 5)=  1 - \sum_{k=0}^{5} P(X = k), \qquad X \sim \text{Bin}(100, 0.04)
$$
Recall the binomial probability formula:
$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} = \binom{100}{k} (0.04)^k (0.96)^{100 - k}
$$
Compute each term from $k = 0$ to $k = 5$ using this formula:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X = 0) &= \binom{100}{0} \cdot (0.04)^0 \cdot (0.96)^{100}
= 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.0166 = \mathbf{0.0166} \\\\
P(X = 1) &= \binom{100}{1} \cdot (0.04)^1 \cdot (0.96)^{99}
= 100 \cdot 0.04 \cdot 0.0173 = \mathbf{0.0692} \\\\
P(X = 2) &= \binom{100}{2} \cdot (0.04)^2 \cdot (0.96)^{98}
= 4950 \cdot 0.0016 \cdot 0.0180 = \mathbf{0.1426} \\\\
P(X = 3) &= \binom{100}{3} \cdot (0.04)^3 \cdot (0.96)^{97}
= 161700 \cdot 0.000064 \cdot 0.0187 = \mathbf{0.1952} \\\\
P(X = 4) &= \binom{100}{4} \cdot (0.04)^4 \cdot (0.96)^{96}
= 3921225 \cdot 0.00000256 \cdot 0.0195 = \mathbf{0.1797} \\\\
P(X = 5) &= \binom{100}{5} \cdot (0.04)^5 \cdot (0.96)^{95}
= 75287520 \cdot 0.00000102 \cdot 0.0203 = \mathbf{0.1234}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we sum these:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X \leq 5) &= 0.0166 + 0.0692 + 0.1426 + 0.1952 + 0.1797 + 0.1234 \\
&=  0.7267
\end{aligned}
$$
Final answer is then:
$$
P(X > 5) = 1 - P(X \leq 5) = 1-0.7267 = \boxed{0.2733}
$$

There is approximately a 27.33% chance of observing more than 5 defective items in a random sample of 100 when the defect rate is 4%.

With normal approximation the answer would be $P(X > 5) \approx 0.2206$ (double check this by yourselves). So the normal approximation underestimates the true probability in this case, not surprising since the sample size is modest and $np$ is close to the lower cutoff for using normal approximation reliably.
